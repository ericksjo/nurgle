or in his case, copius amounts of streaming porn
it monitors what programs are in use and what web pages/documents people visit/work on
bai: it's not being installed on their personal computers
but you would use your work issued computer for porn?
I would recommend not doing that
he just wants to use his work laptop as his personal home computer, and that's not what it is
it's company equipment
(not to mention that using its reports saved us about $40,000 in licensing costs)
people told us they used a piece of software a lot more than they actually did use it

this week was the third round of layoffs and too much stuff to do

why take that off and come back for one day
I have five weeks of vacation now
if I leave that's a big check, it's gonna be awesome
we're just closed christmas through new years
lousy thing about bungie is I expect they won't have many closures or long holidays
although, if they're anything like lucasarts, they give paid holiday for like two weeks after a game release
also I'd be in IT with 20 other people
it's probably way easier with that many

definitely not that

god damn
so after coming in at 11:30, ucw left at 3:15
I'm sure he's thinking that they couldn't possibly afford to lay anyone else off
so why even try
nobody likes dickgirls
except uncola
but you're supposed to hate that
why would you want that

one of the laid off guys gave it to me as a thanks
and then he took me to lunch
and then I'll never see him again
he was the HR/people development guy
I told him I was interviewing and that my boss was lousy
the CEO did that, but he also signed a contract to work through the layoffs to counsel the laid off people
and then left a month early anyway

man, you know there's nobody at work when the coffee is empty at 2
two empty things
hell no
I'm at home
ucw sent some incomprehensible email at 10:15 about being late and then showed up at 11:30
then set his screen to not turn off for two hours and left at 3
pretty much
my boss is in and out, so if the screen is on, you must be out doing important work!
that's how it works
fuck, I got so angry at that
yes
well, more angry that my boss didn't even ask questions about why he was in at 11:30, and no questions after he left
or like on Tuesday he took a three hour lunch
not even a sideways glance
yesterday he got in at 9:45 and left at 11:15 or something
he said he was going home, to work from home
because that's a thing people do, right
they go to work and then leave work to work from hom
e
to be fair, he did go home and work
he had nearly 2.25 hours of work done yesterday
that's an awful lot
yep
he's a manager that doesn't want to manage people
so he doesn't
I'd rather be a manager
because managing is better than doing actual work
I like doing work, but I like not working too
and managing is not working
but telling people to do things is not doing things
right
but you don't have to learn things or do things
I guess
but the gist is, I'd rather manage than work
my dad was an engineer, and before he retired said that he'd been a manager for so long, he didn't know how to engineer
that's like, my goal
well my goal is to do nothing
so...

fat chance
I've been so angry/depressed since yesterday
I've avoided people all day
well, I'm just so unbelievably angry about my boss' total lack of care about ucw
he came in at 11:30 yesterday and left at 3:15
and my boss said nothing
I need a new job
but it's so not unusual
I mean, it's nothing he hasn't done before
but just now it...
yeah
yeah, but in the 3.75 hours he was there, 3.25 of them were spent on facebook/huffpo/wikipedia
meanwhile I'm dealing with two complicated open vmware support cases, trying to get a dead drive replaced in SD, etc
man, they're going to be so fucked when I quit
monday or tuesday
I mean, all the setup is documented and shit, but if you don't know anything about the technologies...
why not use tumblr to look at tits
twitter seems like a really inneficient way to do that
when did twitter start doing that
http://kittiesntitties.tumblr.com/
twitter infinite scroll
probably
I mean, they're probably tagged something like tits
anyway, I'm going to have to talk to my boss again about it
since he's obviously not going to do anything without me prodding him again
he's gay
but otherwise whitebread
he's from utah for fucks sake
probably not, but his skills definitely aren't technology
he was a graphic designer and was fired from our graphics department when they got rid of it
like 14 years ago
he could probably do it if he was willing to learn things and had some initiative, but he's has neither
we've had this sharepoint site up for 2.5 years now, and he's still claiming to be moving content from our old site
we've had a new backup system for two years now, and he just finished getting it set up like 3 months ago
except for replication copies... he's still doing that
and the sharepoint site is ridiculous because he knows nothing, so like pages are all standalone, all basic, he uses sharepoint designer to copy a page and then edits it rather than creating shells that hold other pages or templates
hope nobody ever wants to change part of the design because they'll have to go back and edit every single page
and he's disabled every feature that you'd probably want to use
convert office documents, disabled
profile sync, disabled
office web apps, disabled
there's no point to having sharepoint without using any of sharepoints features
anyway, this is stupid ranting

yeah, this morning
I mean, I have a feeling they have a lot of people applying, and I'm just not the most qualified compared to others
they asked for a lot, and I knew I didn't meet most of what they were looking for, but applied anyway
josh: I have been, yes
there's a helpdesk manager position at teague that I'm pretty qualified for
but I don't really care about the company so that would kinda suck
hyperlook looks dumb
hyperloop too
I can't tell if ucw is doing a phone interview inside the office, or if he's just really poorly talking to a salesman who called his personal cellphone instead of his work phone

I mean, I don't disagree

I cannot believe the insolence !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
anyway, talked with boss about ucw
it's been three months since coworker left
he's noticed that he's not doing much, and has gone back to coming and going as he pleases
I don't know whether to be happy that he's noticed, or incensed that he's done nothing about it
he's not sure he wants to lay him off though, since they might not let us replace him
which I'm going to argue that it doesn't matter since he's just a waste of money regardless
I pointed out that when old coworker left, ucw made intonations that he'd like to get his skills up to speed, learn new things
but hasn't actually done anything
we're supposed to talk more tomorrow
I also said that even when he is there, he's not doing much more than facebooking
we'll see how it goes
I'm guessing he won't talk to me tomorrow

hi
poorly
although I spoke with my boss twice now about ucw, and he's promised to have him do stuff
we're giving him like 1 days worth of work, and giving him a week to do it though...
josh: problem is there's like 10,000 entry level jobs, and 10,000 manager jobs that want 10 years management experience, and like nothing between the two
my boss said he doesn't want to lay off ucw because if he does, management probably won't let him be replaced
and I'm thinking that's not such a bad thing...
aside from my boss, yes
josh: well, they might
since we have a bunch of positions that they're planning on replacing, but they won't let it be replaced right now
like CAD/BIM in PNW, marketing person here, etc
so, if ucw were laid off, he might not be replaced until the end of the year
but for what it's worth, I'm effectively the only person in IT anyway
no, my goal is to get help
keeping ucw here isn't advancing toward that goal
in fact, it's making that goal harder, since he costs a lot of money to keep, and we're going through horrible austerity measures
I mean, we're effectively paying him to post on facebook and chat with his boyfriend
my boss seems willing to do something... as long as I push him
I have to manage my manager...
thug me
tug me
bug me
josh: well, he was willing to tell ucw to do stuff, which ucw promptly ignored and my boss did nothing about
I mean, it would be easy to get rid of him logistically, he's expensive, we could just "eliminate his position" and create a lower level position
well, the problem is my boss doesn't like to manage people
so he doesn't

"I wanted to ask you about the possibility of me taking my computer and monitor with me when I go (exact date is not determined yet). I am looking for an extra computer for home and since my work one is kind of old (almost 3yrs) I didnt think it would be needed"
no
I mean, at this point, the majority of our machines are not under warranty, and worst case, I need these machines for spare parts
during layoffs, a bunch of the people were asking the CEO, and the CEO just overrides whatever we want
we were giving away nearly brand new laptops, meanwhile we're not allowed to replace 4+ year old laptops because it's too expensive

"you're not going to be able to do anything with that 30" monitor so I might as well take it"

since you don't need a second device to actually do stuff
it can be
but you can buy devices
ie, http://www.vizio.com/costar/overview
no, not a dvr
but it's an android device basically
so hulu/netflix/whatever app runs on the device, rather than on a second device which is then streamed
on the chromecast? yes
you can't turn off the tablet or do something else on it
I've used chromecast, switching away causes it to stop
maybe with just netflix (I didn't use that)

and there's no offline bundle?
so basically if you were an enterprise that was dumb enough to install 8, you don't get to update without reinstalling every machine from scratch
well, they've had a couple months to make one...
you can't do upgrades from the install media either
it's just dumb to lock up what is essentially a service pack from enterprise customers

jets score?
those are the biggest fucking cufflinks in history
the worse they poll the better they do?
republicans are polling super low, tea partiers even lower, gop is disliking them too
no, as in the party members are kinda speaking out about the extremism they're exhibiting
rapes: dunno
because the gop maintains tight controls on their primaries
so party leaders could find it easier to exclude them if they continue dragging the rest of the party down with them
but any of that is still a year away anyway

I gotta stop caring about being employed?
I'm not rich like bai
I gotta pay bills
if I stopped caring I wouldn't be employed
that was also 11 years old and got a great deal on it
pft: I just think it's ridiculous that in a group of three people, I couldn't tell you when the other two were going to get to work, or where they were on that day
of course
am I going to be the only one here tomorrow? that greatly affects what I can plan to do
is ucw going to show up at noon and leave at 1? because then I have to answer the phones all day
I don't know when he won't be here
that's kind of part of the issue
for instance, he just got to work
nothing on the calendar indicates that he'll be a couple hours late
usually
anywhere from 1-5 hours late every day
occasionally on time though
right, but if I use official channels, there's documentation and I'll be charged pto
whereas if you just do nothing like ucw, you mark 8 hours even if you showed up at 1 and left at 3:15
I'm not saying it's a unique problem, just that if I do things the way I "should" I just make it harder on myself
yes, because ucw does work outside of work
this isn't a matter of "they're not here but they're still getting their work done"
if that were the case I'd have no problem
if I need them there I ask yes
does that change anything? no
I've repeatedly asked my boss for a week of time where he and ucw would take care of everything so I can setup a test cluster setup without other distractions
it's been over a year and still nothing
but apparently as you and aard keep saying this is totally normal and it will be the same everywhere

the tanks take 100 rpg shots to destroy now
the mbtlaws are less damaging than rpgs?
that's odd
well, I mean it's just odd since it does the juke to the roof thing to maximize damage, but still takes a lot of them
it's not buggy but it will crash randomly during level loads

From 1:30 a.m. to approximately 5 a.m. on Sunday, November 17, ticket machines will not accept credit cards while software maintenance is performed. 
how is that possible
Q. Why are you charging me immediately for my pre-order?
A. Creating and manufacturing new devices is expensive. As a young company, being able to use the revenue from your pre-order to pay for things as we build them helps us reduce risk and helps ensure that we deliver the best possible product and customer service to you.
Q. Why arent you collecting my shipping information when I order?
Q. Can a Coin be used to skim cards? A. No. You can only add cards that you own to your Coin.
so that's a yes
exactly
just skim all the starbucks gift cards then wait for someone to buy them

so my friend's mom was dying, and she took fmla for like a month to be with her, she gets back and they're not going to pay her for two weeks of the time she took off, since she doesn't have vacation time left
she flips out and quits
I don't have the heart to tell her that that's how fmla works...
it just means you have a job when you get back, not that they have to pay you
pft: yeah, now she got one of her friends to buy her a plane ticket to stay with them in wisconsin

rehab
I dunno, the places on intervention always seemed beautiful
alcohol
I found out that she has been there before, so this is at least her fourth rehab
she wants to stay there another month too
so that would bring the total to nearly $40k
Ichabod: this place was $19,400 for 28 days
her brother
plus her mom just died so she's going to get life insurance money, which would pay for the second month
assuming she gets it in time
nope
kaiser covers CDRP, which is their own treatment program
but not these outside inpatient ones
I'd say
well, he only paid $19k
bai: two times was in kaiser, so it was only $10 a day
the first time, I have no idea who paid
bai: well, she's been to this same one once previously
but I don't know what year that was, so it was probably a bit cheaper then

I had a PM call me yesterday at 3 demanding that I get some software for someone, we don't have licenses for it, nothing I can do about it, he doesn't care, it can't possibly be very expensive he'll just order it himself because he has to have it to do his job (he has two other pieces of software that do the same thing)
boss told him he's not authorized, we can't do anything about the software situation, it's management that decided we can't buy stuff
pm being a principal in this case, he runs one of our branch offices
I bet he bought the software himself anyway, because there are absolutely zero consequences in this company
the qualifications are that you say you're a pm
also yesterday had a user ask if they could buy their own SSD to install in the company desktop
part of it is that likely there's no protection between the wireless and the internal network

After paying $12.5 billion for Motorola in 2011, Google is selling whats left of it to Lenovo for less than $3 billion. In what appears to be a huge $9 billion loss, the search giant is coming ahead of its Motorola misadventure, actually paying less than a billion dollars for patents it valued $5.5 billion.

meanwhile, my boss is worried about one of the employees taking a vacation to hong kong, and insisting that we setup a separate vpn profile just for her, because the chinese will hack us

they're like $150 on craigslist
or get a vita tv and stream it assuming they're doing that
I mean, I know they announced it, but are they actually doing it?
well, it will work on ps4 whenever they release it
Ichabod: yeah, I meant they're doing the streaming on the ps4
not a ps4 version of last of us
you can also do it on bravia tvs
if those existed anymore
I mean, they'll release clients for android and ios too

you probably force them to use 1024x768 or something?
because the web developers don't understand flowing design
4:3 or 5:4 monitors are going to go away sooner rather than later
there's probably an extension or an addin to resize the web browser on certain sites
or you could embed it in an iframe that's the correct size
are they stuck using ie7 too?

not like a lever one which is manual, or an automatic one where you don't have control over the pressure
my parents automatic espresso machine sucks hardcore
my drip machine is a thermal thing, it's pretty nice, no spillage, but I have no space

I guess it depends on your definition of fun
I mean, if you have a SAS card already
it's just an enclosure
otherwise you can get smaller sata ones cheaper
probably
if you didn't have a card already, you'd spend 200+ just on that
just find a cheap enclosure and get some sata port multipliers
if you're just looking for cheap

just get a port multiplier or three (that's what those esata enclosures are, mostly)
which is why they top out at 5
http://amzn.com/B00AYHXWYU
pft: not even r2?
I mean, it's the same as 8.1 really
that's a port multiplier
gas cookies
or use an external power supply
like I said, most of those external enclosures with eSATA only are just port multipliers with an enclosure
pft: in r2 just right click on the start button, I mean, it's not quite a start menu, but it works
I used the start menu so little, neither 8.1 nor 2012 bother me

josh hates every state
because everywhere with sales tax does it the same way CA does
josh: most places don't list it with sales tax because of the way the US is structured, there's not like one country-wide sales tax, there's not even a state-wide one, it can vary county to county and even city to city
meaning having to print dozens of different prices

my meeting with that lady is scheduled for that same day

texas lets companies have use it or lose it?
nuts to that
CA lets you limit it to a max amount, but vacation is counted as earned time, so it must be paid out
you're correct, it's not
well, if they'll only let you accrue 56 hours of pto, that's pretty lousy
you couldn't even take a two week vacation
but letting you have a maximum of 56 hours would be fine
zewt: anyway, under ca law, they can cap the carryover, but you must be paid for the time that would be removed
so you have three weeks, they say you can only carry one week after a date, they have to pay you the two weeks pay
that's only a tiny portion of the law
there's no such thing as "expired vacation" in CA, all vacation is earned time, so you must be paid for it
it's just that cashing out the unused vacation when you're laid off or quit is the most common way
which is why so many companies do the "unlimited vacation" thing now
no earned vacation means no liability, no payout when they fire someone
or if they quit

cigutera being a parasite?
Ciguatera is a foodborne illness caused by eating certain reef fish whose flesh is contaminated with toxins originally produced by dinoflagellates such as Gambierdiscus toxicus which live in tropical and subtropical waters. These dinoflagellates adhere to coral, algae and seaweed, where they are eaten by herbivorous fish who in turn are eaten by larger carnivorous fish. In this way the toxins move up the food chain and biomagnify.

tor is secure as long as the government doesn't control the entry and exit nodes
they did it for a couple of nodes, yes
and after that tor software started switching up nodes, rather than always sending things through the same nodes
you're not going through exit nodes
some of them are, for sure
some of them are, for sure
yes, as much as you can be
assuming your devices you're running tor on aren't compromised
bai: even if they did, they couldn't decrypt it
I mean, tor works by encrypting the packet for each hop
so then each hop removes its encryption wrapper
you put it through different hops, each packet gets encrypted differently

I'm trying to get rid of a shared receptionist account, and one of the office managers just complained to me for 40 minutes that we can't do that
the gist of her argument being that people ignore emails, and that everyone is trained to pay attention to emails from the receptionist account
and my arguments, that maintaining auditability and security were not important
"instead of putting it on a big post it note on the computer, we'll just put the password in a drawer!"
that hardly changes the fact that 9 people use that account

I swear to god if this office 365 support dude tells me one more time that it must be the fault of our on premesis exchange server (that we don't have) I'm going to scream
I have no blocks of blank senders as my test tenant is in the cloud but if you are supposed to get these on prem, then that is probably where they are getting wiped out, or even at your firewall or any other scrub devices you have in line after us.
ffffffffffffffuck you
I'm going to get pizza
apparently!!!!!
or so he claims, even though it never touches our firewall
it's a mail rule running on exchange on office 365, and the non delivery mail, generated from exchange in the cloud, isn't getting delivered to exchange in the cloud
so it must be our firewall
now I'm going to get pizza

Ichabod: did you do the DC patch yet?
also, do you use papercut or some other print management software?
yeah, from yesterday
do it soon
it allows any domain user to get domain admin credentials and there's an exploit already in the wild
MS says if the domain is exploited, the only way to get control back is to rebuild the domain
(srsly)
it only has to be done to DCs though
I did it last night
I'm not rebuilding no domain
yes
well, domain admin privileges
about the patch?
he'd probably be more worried about the schannel patch
since that can be exploited on machines that have ssl enabled
triple penetration
that's hot
with an exploit in the wild, it would be stupid not to do it ASAP
since the fix for the exploit is literally burning the world down and rebuilding it
that would probably be fine?

As a special year end thank you for the contributions everyone has made to the success of the firm this year, the Board has decided to approve a Special Year End Bonus to be distributed to all eligible employees at the end of November 2014 equal to 2% of your 2014 base salary.  
2%!!!!!!! that's... not a lot
it's a lot of money for people like the CEO, who make a lot more

I already have enough people complaining that I make them change their password twice a year

also it's going to rain today, and I don't want to go to work
pft: I find it ironic that people love to use that image as a testament to manliness, when it's really boils down to american arrogance
know why nobody talks about britains d-day landings? because they use a naval barrage to take out the emplacements first, rather than just sending a bunch of men to get shot
Ichabod: yeah, but not very much, britain used a sustained barrage to take out everything first
pft: yeah, just north

big flash drive
I'm not sure what I'd do with that

"hey, I have a 2mb powerpoint presentation and I'd like to give people a copy at this conference that I'm going to so can I have 50 drives?"
engineers aren't capable of thinking ahead
I guess I can probably uninstall bf3
is it you
it's good to know thyself
I need to figure out if I want to install 8.1 fresh on this ssd or just clone this win7 install
or maybe go full retard and install 10

For a young MRA named Max von Holtzendorff, the red-pill moment was being accused of sexual harrassment by a co-worker to whom he proposed sex, "being blunt and forthright, because that seemed the best way to ensure consent."
For Dan Perrins, one of the security black shirts, it was the day he ended up in jail ... "I should have killed the bitch five years ago," he tells me. "I'd be out by now."

you hate to hate so much
you might say you like how
I ask dell specifically if the md1220 can do multipathing, clustering, csv, etc, they answer no, but this other model will
I say thanks, but it won't meet our needs then
then they send me a paper that shows the md1220 doing multipathing and clustering and csv
it's just frustrating
well, the thing is the storage expert said no clustering, can't share disks, and only single path
the documentation on their website says the same thing
but then they come up with a white paper that shows that model doing all of those things
well, part of the problem is surely that they have so much overlap in products
I mean, they have three backup softwares that they own
equalogic, powervault, compellent, fluid, whatever else in storage
I think today is just get mad at people day
we license this software, and it uses a network license, so you can have it installed on 20 computers, but only 5 can use it at once or whatever
well, they changed it, so now it'll let as many people run it as they want
and then they come back and charge you
and there's no way to prevent that from happening
even better is they do the usage by the hour, so you can go over without having people use it concurrently
like you have one license, someone uses it, stops at 8:30, then someone else starts it at 8:45, that's an overage

arguing that the reason we don't have enough housing in SF is because of draconian rent control laws
long story short, we want to buy a building, and were looking at a church/apt building, but we'd have to get a change of use permit
and I pointed out that would be hard since SF supes want to increase housing, not decrease it
why is someone watching the clippers

user is told wifi is slower than a wired connection
user complains again that wifi is slow
user is told that their wifi has a lot of devices connected to it, making it slower
user complains that wifi is slow again
user is told there's nothing we can do except kick people's phones off, which the user says no, we shouldn't do that
we just lump personal devices and visitors together
anyway, user continues to complain that wifi is slow and that we need to make wifi faster, and understands that there's nothing we can do, but we still need to make it faster

"This upgrade will be free, and will be delivered exclusively through Windows Update." Windows 10 update via windows update... jesus
upgrade I mean
yes, windows 10 is free if you have 7 or 8
well, they said for the first year, it'll be free
but odds are it'll end up being like the "limited time" price cut to the xbox one
it'll just become permanent
well, it's not 100% free
you're not going to get the full installer for free, you'll need to buy that
why is that dumb?
well, because if you have 7 or 8, you've paid for a license, they're just giving you the upgrade for free
no, they don't make much selling boxed software, but not a lot of people buy that
the real money is volume licenses and OEMs
you could do a clean install (well, you'd have to install 10, then create media to reinstall, then do it clean)
or just use 10's built in "reset to OOB"
if you're determined to do it without a license, you can use the trial version of windows
I'll upgrade to 10, why not

2012r2 is pretty much on par with vmware
except for memory overcommit
I moved all our stuff from vmware to hyperv
same specs just works, different specs requires some different configuration and brings everything down to the feature set of the least featured machine
cores doesn't matter
processor versions matter
if they're the same generation (same features) just different amounts of ram or memory, that's totally fine
er, ram or cores
do you have scvmm?
scvmm isn't free
pretty much
but if you're only doing two hosts, it would be overkill
without it you just use hyperv manager, and add all the servers
yes
nope, it's been nice
but it's a wave, previous version sucked, before that it was great
we're still running some other shit too, it dumps to some readynas things and is so horrible
at least until I totally finish the hyperv conversion
yeah, our things are just readynas pros, not even rack mountable ones
yes
avamar was great
it's just crazy expensive

Ichabod: the only downside to veeam is that it won't do physical machines at all

I played with appassure a bit when I was evaluating things, it was nice, and dell matched veeams price

it will only back up virtual machines
not physical machines

Ichabod: how often do you clean up the WT database?
but not like purge old data?
ok
maybe the newer versions are more efficient, but that gets huge
and the built in clean up tools only do activity, and users that have activity
we have ~130
we haven't updated in like two years
but about two years of data is ~20gb
cutting it down to one year and writing my own cleanup stuff cut like 40 million records out
yeah, it must be better at storing stuff
I should just ditch this thing, nobody really cares about it
Ichabod: at least in this version, there's no retention settings, there's just a database tool that will let you delete data older than x days
but it only deletes session and detail information, documents, apps, etc all stay forever

<Serfer|> shoutout to roommate who apparently has decided to unplug everything instead of cleaning up the boxes and boxes of his stuff
<Serfer> oh hey... he disconnected all of my receiver, speakers, tv, game consoles, NAS, wdtv, and piled them all on the floor
<Serfer> and now he's asked which things he can throw away
because he doesn't like the look of wires, and decided that our living room needed to be flipped
and he didn't "understand what most of those things are"
basically he wants to live on his own, but can't afford to
so he's trying to do everything in his power to make it like he doesn't live with people
and he's moving from a two bedroom, one car garage cottage, to a bedroom in a three bedroom apartment, and obviously he has to get rid of a lot of stuff
and apparently feels that everyone else should get rid of their stuff too
also he unilaterally decided that plastic was unsafe to use as a beverage container, and wants to throw out all the plastic drinking glasses
as well as my coffee mugs (they're mismatched)

I mean, if it makes some soft boil eggs in 30 minutes, if I'm going to make a benedict or something, I have things I can do in the meantime, like fry ham steaks and toast muffins
when I make omelets, it takes 30 minutes anyway

bai: so grounds can't be strapped to the cold water pipe anymore?
bai: yeah, all the outlets in my house aren't grounded
so I was reading up on it, and it's not allowed anymore
which means I guess getting a grounding rod installed?
houses are such a pain in the dick
yeah, it's tied to neutral, which apparently isn't appropriate anymore?
I mean, my plan was to rewire the outlets, not just do some random ones
the breaker box doesn't have a dedicated ground which is also frowned upon
well, if I can do that, it's cake, it's just a matter of running new wire
no, apparently
right, it wouldn't tie at the outlet, I didn't mean that
but the neutral bar is fine?
so I can't just run romex and tie the neutral wire to ground
so I'd have to upgrade to add a neutral bar
er
ground bar
and then the ground bar would have to tie to a ground rod
in addition to neutral
well yes, by upgrade I mean replace the panel
yeah, within 5ft of entering or something
yeah, this is all copper and cast iron, not that it matters
I get to replace the tub drain and p-trap too
right
but pg&e has to upgrade the service to replace the panel?
but at least temporarily, I could swap in romex, and tie the ground to the neutral bar and be fine
unless it's bx in which case I don't have to do much of anything
no
only that it's "appropriate"
anyway, tying to the neutral bar is easy enough

he did
Clinton 50.5%, Sanders 48.9% after 72% of precincts reported
he's gaining
yeah, as I said, santorum won iowa in 2012
and in 92 clinton got 2%
iowa is ultimately meaningless but everyone focuses so heavily on it
probably santorum and gilmore
Clinton 50.3%, Sanders 49.0% with 78% of precincts reporting

Cruz 27.7%, Trump 24.4%, Rubio 22.9% after 81% precincts reporting

if clinton declares herself victor, and actually loses, that would be pretty crushing for her campaign probably

I'm setting up a CA and thinking of putting the guest wireless on a voucher system
it's a no no, but probably nobody would notice
Ichabod: do you have separate wireless connections for guests and internal users?
what about staff personal devices?
I'm trying to get people to stop connecting their personal stuff to our internal network
I'm probably going to have to create a third wireless network if I put the guest wireless on vouchers
one with an unchanging password so they can connect their phones and kindles and ipads and shit to the internet
that's part of it, sure
like someone brings their crypto'd laptop and connects it to our internal network and it starts cryptoing all our stuff
I mean, yeah, but there's still no reason to connect it to all our internal data
sure, but at least I have some control over those machines to try to prevent it
someone's personal system, I have zero control
just like a pad of codes that will give the holder 24 hours of access 
basically you connect to the wireless, it sends you to a captive portal, you get a code, and you get access for a period of time
I'd just create a bunch of sheets and give them to the office managers to give to guests

first to 16 wins
you play 15 and then switch sides
uncounted knife rounds before the game, and the winner decides which side they start on
each gun/accessory costs money, you get an amount for killing someone, or for defusing, and the whole team gets bonuses for winning
they can also build bonuses by losing consecutive rounds
that's why they'll bring up loss bonuses
well, otherwise the team that won would just keep crushing the first losing team, since they'd never be able to buy anything

port protection would tell them if you did that, but they'd have to have that on and setup
router would appear as a single device, but you'd probably have to do some configuration to get all the services to pass through
dumb switches, sure
yeah, unmanaged
managed switches can be used without configuration, usually, but can do a lot with configuration
your phone doesn't have a pass through?
yeah, same here
well, you can get a poe injector
most unmanaged poe switches are just 24v passive 
depending on your phone, you may need 48v
Ignitor: yes, 802.3f and 802.3at are 48v
that's what I was saying
but, you can probably talk to the network people
I mean, they have to expect you to need more than one connection
well, plug in an unmanaged switch, if it works, it'll be fine, if it doesn't work, that means they have port security on
if they're against policy, they probably have port security on
they're probably not looking unless there's a reason to

come fix my water heater
the overheat/overpressure valve is leaking
hi: no, it's leaking leaking, not just condensation, it was a constant stream but I can open the valve and let some water out and it'll change how much it leaks (sometimes worse, sometimes better)
like it was just a constant stream
and now it's just a drip every second
full? no, hot maybe
I doubt it's too hot though, my water isn't that hot
Ichabod: I'm not sure, I have the documents somewhere at home, but I was under the impression it was fairly new
I think when they installed the pipe for the valve, they just damaged it
since it's copper and it was soldered on
a new valve is like $15, I'll just replace it
no, it runs to the side
http://www.plumbingbylaszlo.com/sites/default/files/water-heater-valve.png
the sucky part is going to be cutting the copper piping to remove the valve
I'll replace it with PET though or something
I want to get a tankless one
Ichabod: well, that's also one of those sites that allows anyone to post things
vote by mail people are primarily olds, so they're going to vote for whoever will keep brown people away from them
uhm
also that entire thing is just listing the registration of people who voted
it mentions nothing of who they actually voted for

yeah
who wants to replace my TPR valve for me
I'm going with no
cut the copper, replace the valve, use a short bit of pex or something to bridge the gap
yeah
the pipe is fine
just need to replace the valve
the fittings are certified to 200psi
yeah

yes, all encryption is security by obscurity
that doesn't make it bad
how is it not
I was writing the same thing
obscurity in this case being the data used to encrypt (as in large primes in the case of RSA)
that's not the meaning of security by obscurity
would you say a door key is security through obscurity?
feel free to look at the definition https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity
in a door key, the obscure part is the actual key

this keyboard is so much more sensitive than my old one
it's nice
but I keep making mistakes
so... a little weird
I dunno
I guess tesla will only do installing, not just install it yourself
but we'll see when they start installing it next yeart
year
I'd make money in like 7 years, according to the google calculator
so that's something
I mean, I don't have the 14 grand or whatever it'll cost though, so it's moot
I forget what it costs for me
whatever it is, it's not really a big dewal
deal
14 cents I guess
it's not bad so far
nothing too major
need to replace the flooring though
and windows :|
but it's not urgent
nope
a crawlspace
yeah
I just need to get around to it
I mean, if I put in wood floors, I can probably do most of it myself
yeah
I've kinda been holding off because I think I want to take out a wall in the kitchen, so if I wait, I can put in the same flooring in there too
but kitchens are expensive
I want engineered quartz
oh
yeah, that shit is nice
takes heat and is super strong
yeah
here's what I did last week https://goo.gl/photos/eQd1Sj19vFqt6rEd7
and my kitchen now
https://goo.gl/photos/WeeN7xfBcKqTNEjH6
replaced the T&P valve
temperature and pressure
it's what lets water out if pressure builds up or it gets too hot
right
thing is only 18 years old, but it was all corroded and useless
and just leaking constantly
carefully
they used to last 40 according to my dad
it needs to be replaced, I know
I want to go tankless on that
yeah, I'm old and shit
yeah, I can get a tank one for like $500 or $1200 and get a tankless
if I want to put in radiant, I'll need the tankless
but I'm having second thoughts on getting that done
I don't think my subfloor is thick enough to put that in
tankless are way more efficient
Habz: well, you don't have to keep the water in the tank hot, so it's even better for more people
yeah, aard came back for a minute
it's not fair to talk about geeves when he's too weeded up to type

On Friday, an election judge in Madison County, Illinois, was charged with two felony counts of election fraud for allegedly submitting an absentee ballot on behalf of her deceased husband. Audrey Cook, 88, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch she received the ballots in the mail shortly after her longtime spouse passed away, in September. She said hed made it clear he intended to vote for Trump.

yeah, except it's in new mexico
all the ones I ordered on amazon were new
josh: I had one

that's probably my issue, since my image is from 1511

what a pain

we have several haberdasheries in SF
I don't get this attitude of "this is what you get for calling us racist" attitude that trit, pms, and kilroy are espousing on facebook
Ichabod: do you guys have a lot of vbs? I'm wondering why you have wsh enabled basically
yes, windows script host
the problem with WSH is a lot of like email phishing shit is vbs files
well, he is planning to make it very hard on gays and women
josh: I'm not sure where you see him going back to being moderate, I mean, none of that is in his first 100 day plan, or in any of his statements
so calling me retarded for believing that someone is going to do what they said they were going to do is a bit facetious
right, I've seen that
I mean, he wants joe arpaio to be dhs head
that doesn't sound very sane or moderate
sure
I'm not sure what you're hinting at here
that it's normal?
or are you saying it was fake and didn't happen?
or that transgender people are mentally ill, like you said before
on fake ignore again
and rbw banned you
of course
I'm retarded for caring about things
josh had to unignore me because he wanted to revel in me being sad
it's so cool to be above everything and not care about anything
did they fix you
was it like an intestinal blockage?
poor mulder

hey aard, congrats on getting rid of joe arpaio

I have this dll that I wrote to extend one of our business apps, and it of course runs under the same user the app runs as, but I have to run it as a different, user, and this is just going to end up being a terrible hack I know it
embedding credentials in a dll :|
zewt: well, it's to automatically create project folders when a new project is created
the business app is also our accounting app, so in order to charge time to a project, a new project needs to be created
so it should be the right way to do things
but this app's extension abilities are just, run sql query, call assembly, or call web page
why am I stupid about commas today

 Hello,
Im trying to setup a home wireless printer and the installation for the software had this message:
fascinating, why did you email your company's tech support...
josh: this is a support ticket
we don't support desktop printers at work, let alone someone's personal printer
printers are the worst, desktop printers are more worse, network printers are even worser, and wireless printers are the worsterest

I got a wifi thermostat and need to run a new set of wires :|
no
only two wires
it needs at least three
my furnace only does five wires
what's the sixth wire for?
heating, fan, common, cooling, and heat power
24
yes
well, also cooling power
separate lines
but I don't have cooling anyway
well, that doesn't seem to be always on
and it needs a common connection anyway
well
there are few basements in california
and I'd still have to run wires
so, I might as well just run them from the heater
it needs to be wired to the furnace
furnace is in the attic area
it's cool, I can run new wires fairly easily
I just need to do it

Dov Katz, the head of computer vision at Oculus VR, was arrested near Seattle on December 21 for allegedly soliciting sex from an underage girl. According to charging records, Katz allegedly attempted to pay $350 to have unprotected sex with someone he thought was a 15-year-old girl.

it's a bit annoying to move a couple windows back around, but it's not really a big deal
happens to me with dvi and dp
no
geforce 1080
well, and quadro k4200 at work
the monitor goes to sleep and it stops telling dp that it's there, so it's just like removing it
so all the windows migrate to other screens when it wakes up
it redetects them and puts it back the right order
but the windows stay where they were, mostly
where they were as in the other monitor
well, I have two dp monitors and a dvi at work
so, they tend to stay on the dvi one
MST does some funky shit though, so I can't store the edid
psibawb: multistream
how dp does high res or multiple monitors on a single connection

is zewt saying that android is not designed to be used on a phone?
remember when iphones couldn't run more than one thing at once
getting disconnected when you click a link in irc
well, the things it can do when it's not active are restricted, yes
but it's not like it closes your irc app when you go to a webbrowser
as long as the screen is on
unless you have youtube red
which is probably why they made teh change
most of the problems with android have to do with it being the most popular phone os in the world
a great many different devices, with different capabilities, with different screens, etc
let's ignore programming in it
the notification that just shows a 1 on the settings app?

people said exactly the same thing about gen x
it's almost like old people don't like young people
what differences
the differences between millennials and gen x?
well, gen x had it easier, so they deperately try to fuck over the younger generation, like the baby boomers did to them
there's really no difference at all, it's just people trying to sell something that say there are differences
nobody has ever quit after a month until millenials existed?
I don't think that's normal
but it's not unusual
none of my friends have quit after a month at a job
I've had them change after a year
one changed twice in 365 days
but, they all worked shitty jobs, they traded up

millenials like to have fun, they like flexibility, they like having a work life balance

things that everyone wants
they want to be able to advance

stop attacking me hi

some of our engineers went to kpmg
_Hi_: yeah, probably
I had some of our engineers in LA stop me and yell at me because they didn't want to be on the IM system ever
people can contact them through it!
and they can't ignore an im, like they can ignore a phone call or email
for some reason
and sometimes they need to avoid a client, because every client needs to feel like they're our only client
_Hi_: I'm not sure why they think they can't ignore an im
and I'm also not sure how  ignoring a phone call or email is better service than ignoring an im
we're switching to skype for business for our phones, so people have to be on im if they want to get phone calls
oh, I see
unfortunately, the online versions don't let you choose who can get outside ims
it's either on or off for the whole company
so I have a big group saying that outside ims are the best, they use it all the time, it really improves communication
and then another group that says it's the worst, nobody should ever contact them so they can avoid doing work
offices
mainly
our oakland office loves it
la office hates it
things like accounting or marketing or the c levels mostly don't give a shit either way
hey bawb, do you wanna know how dumb I am?
I realized like this weekend why pro cs players are always whipping out their knives and hitting the walls

Paddy Power is now putting 4-1 odds on Trump getting impeached within the first six months of his presidency. Additionally, the website thinks its even more likely that Trump will not finish his first term, as it gives him just 7-4 odds of completing four years in the White House.
Other popular Trump-related bets on Paddy Power right now include video of his golden shower incident leaking onto RedTube (5-1 odds); splitting with wife Melania Trump (15-1 odds); and painting the entire White House gold (500-1 odds)
painting the white house gold is pretty plausible

The dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America is wrong. The Trump Administration will end it.
Next, we will rebuild the American military. Our Navy has shrunk from more than 500 ships in 1991 to 275 in 2016. Our Air Force is roughly one third smaller than in 1991. President Trump is committed to reversing this trend, because he knows that our military dominance must be unquestioned.
Peace through strength will be at the center of that foreign policy.
yeah! let's go to war!

massive military build up doesn't mean war?

"Who is the person to talk to?" the lawyer asked, according to the complaint. The unidentified CBP agents responded: "Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump."

also, some russian oligarch that trump supposedly talked to before the election just flew to florida at the same time
kevlar trash bags
https://i.imgur.com/5J8kHrV.jpg I want to believe
wewd: though to be fair, they did it so the press can't see the president, who is outside golfing, from inside the resort, the other times they blocked out windows was because the president was inside somewhere
those are outdoor doors
https://twitter.com/OutFrontCNN/status/830220071133970432 oh man those are some harsh terms there
right, because he was inside
wewd: "After Trump and Abe had entered, reporters  including a Japanese contingent  were led down to a basement suite where windows were covered with black plastic so they couldnt see out."
"Once there, the traveling press pool was escorted into the clubhouse and downstairs into what was supposed to be a room to file stories. That's when they saw the blackout. "The door and windows are covered with black plastic so we can't see out," the official White House pool report stated. The reporters were told they would be there for awhile, according to press pool reports."
weird that the press is saying that's where they're being held
japanese press being held in the same room
holy fuck, more assholes emailing me about the outage
gee, I said it was out of my hands, but maybe if you all email me seperately it'll get done quicker somehow

thank god this guy responded to my second email asking people not to email me about the connection being down because I can't do anything to make it go faster to say that he really needs internet access

The Adventures of Milo and Otis ( Koneko Monogatari?, lit. "A Kitten's Story"; alternate English title, The Adventures of Chatran) is a 1986 Japanese[2] adventure comedy-drama film about two animals, Milo (an orange tabby cat) and Otis (a pug).

people "trying" to become fulltime streamers are super weirdos

I watched that ninja guy, and he was flipping out, freaking out because he installed some mouse software

he then unplugged his mouse, swung it around the room and smashed it on the ground

intelligence community
they hacked information and funneled it to trump
I mean, emails are the most obvious
I don't think it's fair to refer to bernie as a queen
yes, people are the weakest link
the easiest to hack
and that was just one of them, btw
ok
just one of the email hacks
that was just what's his names account that was attacked that way
no

Brexit leader and top Trump ally Nigel Farage spent almost an hour inside the Ecuadorian embassy where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange lives, but then told reporters he couldnt remember what he was doing there.

Less than 24 hours after Kellyanne Conway appeared to suggest that the Obama administration may have used microwaves that turn into cameras to spy on Donald Trumps campaign headquarters, the Trump adviser has admitted she has zero evidence that this actually happened
haha what
She also added that microwaves that turn into cameras could be used in surveillance, since we know this is a fact of modern life.
I assume so
It was about surveillance generally, she told CNN of the interview. Im not Inspector Gadget. I dont believe people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign. However, I have, Im not in the job of having evidence. Thats what investigations are for.
inspector gadget
really
kellyanne conway, the best and brightest

does anything happen to people who do?
because I keep telling people not to do it and they keep doing it
and everyone here is just *shrug*
oh, so first time is a warning, second time is firing?
no matter how many times I tell people not to, everyone gives their password to everyone
like our ceo practically gives it to anyone that walks by his office
there's a binder literally labeled "<CEO Name> passwords and accounts" on his assistants desk
unlocked of course
Ichabod: my boss wouldn't do anything anyway, he'd just shrug
like, our management committee and board create all sorts of rules, but as soon as anyone breaks any of them they want to be exempt or not enforce the rules
of course
we are the engineer of record for VA projects
yeah, all I got was a shrug and "tell them not to do that"
hooray
also I keep getting told that two weeks isn't enough warning about changing passwords
but when I made it longer, people just ignored it because it was too far off
I'm beginning to think people don't actually care, they just want to blame someone else

pocketpro: I did that, but my garage door isn't weighted right
no, it doesn't go down
like, the door has to go down on its own essentially
and once mine was up, it doesn't move
probably
basically, you need the whole thing at an angle, with progessively larger brackets the higher the door piece, so it just goes downhill when the spring is unloaded, but sits flush
mine was definitely made to be hand lifted and lowered

"my computer is really slow when I plug it in and it's happening to everyone else too" "plug it into what?" "just in general" "right, but power, network, peripherals?" "network, it makes both the network and computer slower" "how many other is it happening to, and how are they testing?" "I've heard it happen before, it doesn't matter if I'm plugged in or not"
what is your problem?
so his computer is slow when plugged in and not plugged in, but it only happens when it's plugged in

well, the reports all said that this information was so sensitive we didn't share it with our allies

so you don't think the russian interference happened?
everyone being people who voted for trump?
well, that's known to be russia
they released a bunch of emails, yes
well, most people didn't actually read them, they just listened to breitbart, drudge, foxnews, etc, as to what they think they said
and after everyone was hyping that fact that she had a _private email server_ the fact that someone related to her campaign had their email hacked was obviously meant to play on those fears
well, she got a disproportionate sentance, longer than any other leaker, and then was kept in solitary confinement the entire time
she was taken advantage of by another russian agent, julian assange
I think some of it was ok, the fact that wikileaks released everything without censoring or sorting was pretty bad too
I mean, obviously yes
what was so bad in any of those releases?
that changed americans opinions on america?
<Serfer-> well, most people didn't actually read them, they just listened to breitbart, drudge, foxnews, etc, as to what they think they said
there was nothing damaging about bernie sanders in the leaks
most of the stuff that people think was about the dnc favoring clinton was written after the sanders camp had no chance, when they should have been favoring clinton, because she would be the candidate
no
clinton was way ahead the entire time
why discount them?
this is like trump saying he won the popular vote because if you subtract all the votes for clinton, he has the majority
how many superdelegates changed their votes to sanders then?
she was
oh ok
of course
every day it was another post "here's how bernie can still win"
he stayed in even after it was impossible for him to win
most people don't seem to realize that bernie sanders was not a democrat though
he left the democratic party to be an independant

I mean best case scenario you'd only get 12w
right?
oh, the speakers in that bundle aren't the speakers you pasted
well, that thing only takes usb as power, so that's 500ma, split into two output channels would be 250ma each, the speaker power outputs 48v, so 48*.25=12

"The White House is telling federal agencies to blow off Democratic lawmakers' oversight requests, as Republicans fear the information could be weaponized against President Donald Trump. At meetings with top officials for various government departments this spring, Uttam Dhillon, a White House lawyer, told agencies not to cooperate with such requests from Democrats, according to Republican sources inside and outside the administration."

Top lawyers with at least four major law firms rebuffed White House overtures to represent President Trump in the Russia investigations, in part over concerns that the president would be unwilling to listen to their advice
The concerns were, The guy wont pay and he wont listen, said one lawyer close to the White House who is familiar with some of the discussions between the firms and the administration
haha
they talk about that
that the pr would be bad, hurt existing relationships, and hinder future recruiting

why would you swipe or insert when you weren't ready to pay
that saves zero time you realize
it probably takes longer, since you have to pull out your wallet twice
except you are behind because you stopped to insert at the begining
and behind even more when you pull out your wallet a second time to put the card back in
swipe at beginning, swipe at end, all you're doing is time shifting
takes the saem amount of time

Hi John, 
Will you make these emails stop? I've been gettint one everyday for a few weeks.
sure? why not
no
it's an email that tells him a project he's trying to file time to is closed
yeah, I get emails like that too
"hey, I sent you this a couple weeks ago, I know you're probably busy but"
"haven't heard back from you, I know you're busy but"
there's also someone doing something similar for janitorial services, but sending to me
I think it must be an automated system in some way
egay
what would encryption do if you had the credentials?
we have this thing called bridgit here, it's a screensharing app that users seem to love, not because it's real good, but because you can draw directly on top of the screen, rather than on a whiteboard or something
they switched to a cloud based thing a couple years ago, and jacked the price up on the in house version
so we'd have to pay 60k to run a whiteboard
so we're using this 8 year old version that we own that's still exploitable to like every ssl issue
and to make it worse, nobody ever puts a password on their shares
so literally anyone can join these things
and when I said I was going to shut it down, because it's a huge issue, I nearly had a riot
anyway, it's just crazy that I still have to run this horribly insecure server, because people want to draw directly on top of a screen
but then how does the remote person see it??? please go to this website and download this unsigned exe and run it

and then he tells me that it suddenly stopped working
and every time it's because he still hasn't opted out of at&t's dns breaking
which they've been doing for like a year now
so every couple months he calls to remind me that he's defrauding the company
.1%
should have kept it base 8
they gave me 10% this year, and like a 4k bonus, and promised to promote me to a position that doesn't exist
and still doesn't exist
maybe they can just fire me instead
I need to gtfo
I guess it depends what's wrong with it?

Well, I didn't tape him, eh, you never know what's happening when you see that the Obama administration or perhaps, longer than that, was doing all of this unmasking and surveillance and you read all about it and I've been reading about it for the last couple of months about the seriousness of the... and the horrible situation with surveillance all over the place and you've been hearing the word 'unmasking', a word you probably never heard before. So you 
never know what's out there, but I didn't tape and I don't have any tape and I didn't tape, but when he found out that I -you know- that there may be tapes out there, whether it's governmental tapes or anything else, who knows? I think his story may have changed, i mean, you'll have to take a look at that, because then he'll have to tell what actually took place at the events and my story didn't change, my story was always a straight story, my story was 
always the truth, but you'll have to determine for yourself whether or not his story changed but I did not tape.
oops

vine is gone
also, cnn's statement from a couple hours ago directly says the opposite josh
anyway
it's the same story
they said the same thing in the original story
The two paragraphs, as multiple journalists (including myself) pointed out, read a lot like CNN essentially threatening to dox someone  meaning reveal a persons private identity  if that person didnt behave as CNN demanded. The apparent threat quickly took off on social media under the hashtag #CNNBlackmail, with mostly conservatives and Trump supporters calling out CNN for what would be seriously unethical behavior for a major media organizati
that was in the original story?
that's super weird
that's in the story yes
they didn't change that
no?
he apologized and deleted it before they talked to him
which is what it said in the original, and what it says now, and what their statement this morning said
it's not what it says?
ok
come on, at least read what I pasted earlier

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882418323673239553
just because breitbart has a story that says they threatened him and forced him to write an apology doesn't make it true
the story didn't change, feel free to check the cached version
I mean, those are the sources, anyone else is just speculating
he author of the piece, Andrew Kaczynski, has said the two paragraphs were not meant as a threat. He said that HanAssholeSolo apologized for his behavior on social media  with a post on the subreddit r/The_Donald  before CNN talked to him by phone but after CNN reached out to him through email.
I don't think either of us has the ability to determine what was in the email
that's a vox story btw
not cnn or andrew k

which is why first person sources are frowned upon

then they report that it was some fat dude that set up the meeting with a lawyer from the russian mob, as a favor for the son of the guy that (according to the steele doss) made the piss tape
then his story changes to, I met with the russians to get stolen emails from hillary, but it turns out they didn't have them, and wanted to talk about lifting sanctions instead
also, they documented the whole thing in emails that the nyt has
donny jr hired an italian mob lawyer today, there was no on camera briefing, and the pres held no public appearances
also the son of the guy who made the piss tape is a singer, and donald trump appeared in one of his music videos
haha, if only
donald trump in trapped in the closet part 420
haha, I mean, djt uses tape on his extra long ties
http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-clinton-server-hack-claim-i-think-i-read-n597891 a year ago, two weeks after the meeting donny jr, manaford, and kushner had
someone told him, he thinks, that clinton's server was hacked
also, in other comedy, the guy who arranged the meeting also attended it, and checked in at trump tower on facebook on the day of the meeting

yeah, he tried to collude about hillary, but instead they only talked about colluding on lifting sanctions

chrome now redirects http://help to http://settings for some reason

it's impossible to search for this issue too
nothing

well, I guess there's already a bug filed for this, chrome just updates slow for me, and the bug tracker search for http://help doesn't work

psts can be used to violate retention rules

iHi: you file those in your records retention, not your personal email, what happens when you're gone

you can? how do you add additional ones?
yeah, I have several weapons, but I can only put one in each slot
oh
mine is a dumb bubble
I'm gonna have to switch it to the leap strike
also switch my double jump, this floaty rocket shit is awkward
I don't recall that from d1
v
yeah, I'mma have to do that too
with that you can just jump over all the strike jumping puzzles
fuckin' intune still requires silverlight?
what is this shit
yeah, it was desktop first
it's basically cloud sccm
like sccm is great a desktop and bad at mdm, intune is bad at desktop and good at mdm
good news, you still need wsus
it's pretty easy to setup, fortunately
sccm is a monster to learn
like, just the console is intimidating because there is so much stuff there
do you have the clients deployed to your machines?
if you're thinking you might go full spe at some point, you have to remove sccm clients before you install intune
I don't think my boss is coming in today...

do you not know how to read either?
if you come here without documentation, you end up in jobs that aren't legal, and because you lack documentation you fear authorities, so you don't report crimes in your community or done to you, which breeds more crime
sanctuary cities simply remove the fear of workign with authorities
you don't think that if there's a population that can be illegally taken advantage of without consequence that people won't take advantage?
you've never thought "oh, I shouldn't do that, it's illegal?"
are you suggesting that the justice system is not part of society?

sony's 4k android tv is <1k for a 65", and it's nice
but you can get one of the cheaper 55" lg oleds for like 1500
tritian: well, that's why you get it delivered
tritian: but yeah, it depends, edge lit ones can be real light
I mounted one of the 65" sony 4k tvs by myself
well, the sony I mentioned was 900
but not oled, yeah
I've seen the 55" lg oled for 1500, but cheapest I can find it now is 1800
yeah
well, I still have it
but I replaced it, yeah
I need to put it on craigslist or something
if you're buying new, you might as well get a 4k, but if you have a fine tv already, no need to get a 4k
what is a wallpaper tv
it's just an oled tv
yeah, the thickest part of an oled tv is the electronics aprt
part
that tv just uses a thin cable to separate the electronics from the display
no, backlit ones are often uniformly thick, rear projection tvs are obviously thicker, etc

When his old campaign manager was indicted Monday, Mr. Trump called me on the phone, crying like a baby, and begged me to endorse him. I said, "You're already president, Mr. President. You were elected." He said, "I'd still like your endorsement." I have a recording of the phone call. It's so sad. Donald Trump is done.
why would he call garrison keillor

do you have a house worth less than 500k and make less than a million a year?
if so you'll pay more and your house will decrease in value
but your employer will save money, which is the important thing
because mortgage deduction being lowered, so house prices will probably crash
the majority of homes are financed
that statistic would suggest so
no
that would simply suggest that of all houses sold, >50% have a mortage
mortgage
yes, it only would affect new mortgages, which would in turn affect your resale value

well
it was supposedly the yemeni airforce that fired a single missile
but that was probably fake
in addition to the helicopter crash and plane crash yesterday that killed a bunch of princes
after all those other princes got arrested
they're powerful enough outside of SA to be arrested and have their assets seized
it's just a power play by one of the princes since the king is about to die
they also said that iran was behind the yemen missile for some reason
I mean, you couldn't just kill off the guy that owns 50% of fox news and not raise some questions probably
but you kill off all the princes that only own internal stuff and it's fine, nobody bats an eye

a big driver is that there are two engineers that say we're giving them bad equipment, we're not getting them the fastest available machines
which is true

our ceo also wants to move everything (everything) to the cloud
and we feel like we've moved what makes sense to move
anyway, he's getting demoted to be "toy manager" to manage our drones, snake cameras, laser tapes, laser levels, rebar detectors, ultrasonic thickness gauges, etc
right after his meeting where he was told that, he scheduled the next two days off
I think he's going to quit
anyway, they're going to look for a new director, and I don't think they'd take me

easy d
it's been a long time since I made a vc++ project, but I've included a header, and it's taking the constants, and will even show me the definition of functions, but says the functions don't exist
even better is that this company's sample app doesn't compile either
yeah
the lib file is added, and set in the linker opts
identifier not found
it even autocompletes it
yeah, the only one that comes with this sdk
y
I dunno, I hit f5 to compile
?
DWORD WINAPI PTRobot_Initialize();
that's in the header
PTRobot_Initialize();
doesn't matter
Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error	C3861	'PTRobot_Initialize': identifier not found	Switchdisc	c:\projects\switchdisc\switchdisc\switchdisc.cpp	13	
sure?
like I said, it's pulling all the info from the header
constants and function defs
this is just debug yeah
can you not include the full path?
#include "D:\f\ptrobot\Header and Lib\Unicode\PTRobot.h"
fuck vc
if that's the case, why is it reading the header?
sure?
like I said, it's pulling all the info from the header
constants and function defs
ok
I put them in the same directory
same error
no, they're in the same directory as the cpp
yeah
josh: it auto-generates stdafx.h and puts it in the same dir
so I assume
brandon: yeah, I was given this sdk
I didn't realize that vc can't handle headers
this is the easiest thing in gcc
why does vc fuck it up
they're in the same dir
I moved them
it includes a header there
if I don't include the function call it compiles
you wouldn't copy the files?
that'll make it hard for people who don't have a second hard drive
yeah, it was working so well
ok
putting the header directory there changed nothing
exact same error
it feels really wrong to hardcode the header directory to d:\f\ptrobot\etc because nobody else is going to have it stored there
psibawb: it's finding the header, it's pulling all the definitions
ok
so I changed the header include dir and nothing changed
like I said before
ok
yeah
I got the error
PTRobot.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)
the linker is that
like 2k
didn't you just say I couldn't use full paths
whatever
ok
adding the full path to the linker also did nothing
"D:\f\ptrobot\Header and Lib\Unicode\PTRobot.lib";%(AdditionalDependencies)
which still seems really wrong
since nobody else will ever be able to open this
I can't move these to the same directory?
sparse: you can't full path the include apparently
trash
haha
to use a precompiled header you have to tell it to not use prcompiled headers
makes sense
you'd think if the ide is smart enough to pull the data from the files you add, it would be smart enough to use that data
https://streamable.com/5mvhy
josh: I understand what they are
I'm saying it's not ignoring them, the gui is populating
there aren't any ifdefs
except the basic #ifdef __cplusplus extern "C" { #endif  /* __cplusplus */
yeah
we were marveling at how dumb msvc is as an ide

plex wrote a "winamp replacement" and they talk up how small and fast it was (is), and then they wrote their own winamp for plex! except it is the opposite of small and fast, "combination of ES7, Electron, React, and MobX" 
the one nodejs process is gonna take more than every copy of winamp combined
and that combination doesn't even play the music "As for the actual audio player, we wanted to do things which werent easy or even possible with Web Audio, so we picked a feature rich, portable, open source audio player called Music Player Daemon (MPD)."

why would you need spotify if you have winamp

also putting banana plugs on my speaker wires was the best thing I ever did
aside from they don't fit in stereo equipment
seems like this stuff should be easy to do with most of the android socs running some rtos, some external amps and an hdmi switch chip, maybe some ad for the analog video connections
here's a more modern amp https://static.webshopapp.com/shops/188510/files/093827636/dayton-audio-dta-2-class-t-digital-audio-amplifier.jpg
just a couple small caps
that's basically what I use for my computer speakers, works great
well I live alone and can blast my music so I have speakers and shit
it's actually what I'm currently doing

Ichabod: nope

Ichabod: what lets you set number of delays?
if I force people to reboot over weekends, what if an engineer starts running something friday and needs the results monday??? or if they don't save the 1000 documents they have open before they leave for the weekend???
so I can never reboot literally anything
iHi: I can't get people to read emails about power outages, reboots they'll just never see
I have people get the reboot notices for months, and then complain that they don't have a way to stop the updates when it takes 30 minutes to reboot
literally this morning, "I just rebooted, but it says it's going to take a while, is there any way to stop it?" "no" "but I have a deadline!"
we instill in people the idea that the computers are their personal machines
so much so, that I've had at least three people ask to take their desktop machines and monitors with them when they quit
you like special cases?

do you often put things you're trying to read between two monitors?
my boss is explaining to me that people do that all the time, that's why everyone has to have two monitors that are exactly the same
putting big black borders in the middle of what I'm trying to read sounds like a bad idea
sure, but that's what scaling is for
and aside from that even if scaling is off and the monitors are different res, it doesn't change the alignment
they might look different, but it doesn't change how the text is displayed
I just think it's fully emblematic of the privelege we instill in our stupid employees by buying brand new monitors for someone because they didn't like that the other brand new monitors

Geeves: lastpass that shit
^^
two factor is still pretty segmented
yeah
lastpass makes it easier than not having it, once you've logged in (and installed their extension) it just fills in passwords for you
I have it turned on
and when you create accounts or change passwords, it'll create ones for you and save it
so you never even have to know the password
free or $12 a year for some extra features
iHi: that's free now
it has an app
it's just a web browser
so you open the app, select what you're going to login to, and it logs you in, then you can switch to the non-lastpass browser
I dunno about app logins, fuck apps
if you're worried about lastpass being compromised, try keepass
you'll have to host your own password file though
yeah
many clients will let you access key files stored on dropbox or google drive or whatever though

and that's the guy that they decided to have help choose my new boss, instead of anyone who works in it
nope
my assistant picked up once, and he told her that he didn't want to talk to her, he wanted to talk to somebody who knew what they were talking about
he started off that whole conversation by telling me to stop chatting him, because it's too time consuming, so I said, ok, whatever, and went back to what I was doing
so then he starts calling
but I'm not at my desk so I of course don't hear it

how you doin
I can't believe I'm going to get fired before you do
because one of the guys choosing my new boss h9s me
the guy I had to file two complaints about
no
his behavior
he likes to insult people in the IT department and be extremely condescending
he told my assistant, when she picked up the phone that he didn't want to talk to her, he wanted to talk to somebody who knew what they were talking about
but the second was because I can't tell him who deleted a file, we don't have that kind of auditing on, and he insists that's not the right answer, and I need to give him a different one, to the point where he was shouting at me over the phone
by internally raging to the point where I'm physically shaking
he's an associate, which is like the 4th highest level I guess, but they gave him a secondary title "technology implementation manager"
mostly manage a shitload of servers
but I'm also like the top tier support, so I do have to fill in on regular helpdesk sometimes, like when my assistant is out

I have one of those water flossing things, and it's probably been used less than two dozen times

hi: they're apparently trying to learn for bungie's mistakes
so they're still tying the two games together somehowe
somehow
I dunno
they obviously feel they're on the right track in some way
I guess they fixed everything in the last patch
and they're updating all the old missions in the next two
More than a years worth of updates rectified nearly all of the games issues, culminating in an impressive, expansive 1.8 patch that added new modes, new maps and was met with widespread acclaim.
 The 1.8 patch adding new zones in the game that constantly generated new missions for solo players
maybe I'll try 2
I guess I didn't learn from destiny 2
just like bungie!

i don't like josh because he is mean
can we all change our nicks to some version of Serfer please
so when he comes back he'll really feel the show of solidarity
everything about that hurt so much including the 10% battery
i guess sparse is taking over the bad links
at least we have that figured out
why should i
you're bad linking and you're bad link king
i feel like i can get away with whatever i want under this nick because the bar is so low
it's really freeing
he will
i'm the serfer this channel deserves
but not the one it needs
every time i tab back to this chat room i'm dismayed because it looks like serfer is the last one who talked
but it's actually just me
which is actually even more dismaying
i should just kill myself
i'll fucking beat you up

we just need more guns
drnzypoo: that was the most american shooting spree ever
chain restaurant -> walmart
I mean, aside from shooting sprees being pretty uniquely american in the first place
Xeus2: which?
his problem was that he didn't think the girl was armed, so she walked by him, and he pulled out his gun on the dude, and the lady just turned around and shot him
if only there was another person with a gun there
good thing america is the most populous nation in the world, otherwise we could look at other countries for why they don't have so many spree shootings
but not so many mass shootings
so your point is violence exists elsewhere so we should just accept that people will be killed
like canada, australia, japan, britain, well known for their gun violence
diversity is bad?
well, I consider people dying to be bad, and your assertion is that diversity causes more people to die
well you're saying that diversity causes more spree shootings
he's asian
but you would hardly consider rwanda and industrialized modern nation
a better look would be at britain, which is fairly diverse and has very little gun violence
well, you could easily look at the nordic countries
we could concentrate them all in some sort of camp

that was anticlimactic
he just walked in, grabbed his headphones, someone came to ask him a question, and he said "I JUST GOT LAID OFF" and walked out
no, I was talking to someone else
yes
they "eliminated his position"
indeed

he walked back in, grabbed his headphones, someone started to ask him a question, he loudly (but not shouting) said "I JUST GOT LAID OFF" and walked out
and that was it
his pistachios and corn nuts are still here
anyone want them
yes, well he did it by saying that they were eliminating his position
they no longer needed someone in his job
well, my boss just now asked about splitting up ucw's job duties between us, and was only able to come up with one thing he did
so apparently my boss doesn't know what he did either
true
he was fired today

now the problem is I have a fourth interview tomorrow

Berkeley's City Council recently approved an ordinance that requires the citys three medical marijuana dispensaries to donate pot to patients who makes $32,000 a year and up to $46,000 a year in a household of four. The goal is to have Berkeley dispensaries give about two percent of the cannabis they sell annually to low-income patients.

In February 2011, OkCupid was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp, operators of Match.com, for $50 million. Editorial posts from 2010 by an OkCupid founder criticizing Match.com and pay-dating as exploiting users and as "fundamentally broken" were removed from the OkCupid blog at the same time. In a press response OkCupid's CEO commented that the removal was voluntary.

yes, sf is great
which part, sf being expensive?
well, I'm not sure which parts you're referencing, but SF is stuck in a hard place because there are lots of things compounding the issues
some areas of SF have height restrictions on buildings, which will never let the density build to where it should be, artificially limiting housing
in addition prop 13 makes it so it is disfavorable to buy/sell your property, since taxes are locked to the price when you bought it
also getting transit across different areas is difficult because of the waterways, the surrounding counties are reticent to put money into it because they feel it ruins their character
for instance, when BART was being built, Marin didn't have the tax base to support the funding for the Marin arm of BART
which is a small part of why Bart doesn't go anywhere

tech blogs just love to fellate apple
this gizmodo article in the begining states that phablets are stupid
and then goes on to say that an iphone phablet would be the best thing ever
bai: I think different form factors are a good idea
nobody's mad about it
I was just pointing out the hypocrisy in claiming that something is stupid, unless apple were to do it, then it's a good idea

this chick on a bus stole someone's cellphone, smashed it
got in a fight with the owner
then peppersprayed her
and the rest of the bus she was on
when the bus stopped she fell out of it and was wrestled to the ground
then police showed up and mashed her face into the ground
it was pretty great
yeah
that's like two felonies together
and she was wearing a really short skirt and trashy patterned fishnet stockings that were too small for her
she was a big girl
racist
all she was saying was "I need more help"
which continued as the police wrestled her to the ground
and then after they handcuffed her
nope

I was only there for the falling off the bus and police parts
the rest were told to me by other people on the bus

Do not use a "debugger". A debugger is like doing a full-body scan on a sick person. You do not get any specific useful information, and you find a whole lot of information that doesn't help and is just confusing.
The best way to debug a program is to use print to print out the values of variables at points in the program to see where they go wrong.

any recommendations for non shitty computer speakers?
looking at this, http://amzn.com/B004H0MQYW
I need some bass up in this bitch
christ that makes it expensive
not sure if I want another set with an integrated amp
but I don't want a full fucking receiver either
which leaves like 0 sets
it requires power, but it doesn't have an amp?
what the hell kind of speakers are these
rapes: that's what I'm trying to find
I can't find one
hmm
I have an onkyo in the living room
I don't have space for one in my bedroom

if you mean the decoded stuff... kinda

yeah
it gets removed slower
so it's still there for a couple hours after the nntp stuff is pulled
me too
we're all screwed
yeah, I do all my stuff over ssl

it's on neither
it was on both, then it was removed from nntp, then it was removed from autounrar

they work, they just crackle and pop without anything playing
drnzy: yes
no, it's not the ups
it does it when not on the ups too
and it's not switching to battery
could be pot noise
guessing it's that at this point
maybe combined with an op-amp that's gone bad
unfortunately I don't have a way of bypassing this pre-amp to test that
yeah, that was going to be my next thing
I might be better off just replacing the thing
http://amzn.com/B004H0MQYW stupid computer speakers
I got handed a project where I'll be forever replacing pieces
because I can't tell which one is bad
and now these stupid speakers are picking up monitor noise
it's not hum, it's unlistenable noise
and the left channel cuts out too
I mean, it's probably the pot but it's such a pain...
and there's no port to clean the pot
drnzy: I also can't find a replacement pot on digikey

I gave people two weeks to do something, and of course nobody did anything until this morning
well, I've only sent like 6 or 7 emails about it
and I still get people who semi-proudly tell me, "hey, I haven't read any of your emails or read the directions you posted on the intranet, can you walk me through this and tell me everything I need?"
we're switching to a new email provider
and I asked everyone in the company to add it
yes
not exactly
then you would lose all your email
our current email provider is a black box, we have no access aside from getting email into outlook
so I need people to copy their email to the new provider
"email" is strictly IT?
I didn't know
all these people are doing all this IT work by sending me email
let me do that for all 300 computers
in 6 locations
mbac: I really can't, I just described why I can't
mbac: and we can't switch piecmeal because mx records don't go to two places
at least in the future, if we ever need to switch, we can do hybrid deployments
mbac: we also have to pay for both accounts
so the longer we keep people on both systems, the longer we double pay
mbac: it's not breaking, and yes
they sell drugs, literally
mbac: also, there's no federation, so the passwords on our local domain aren't the same as the email passwords (my boss likes this) so I don't have a way of auto-adding accounts anyway

Xeus: fed up with work
things don't get done unless I do them
we're transitioning to office 365, and I've literally done all of the work
aside from my boss creating the groups
and there was a power shutdown in our sd office friday night, so of course I had to shut down everything and bring it back up on saturday
and do the mx changeover sunday, and also the LoB mail bits, and the relay
and of course the relay wasn't working so I had people calling all day about that, and people waiting until the last minute to change their mail client
I was on the phone from 6:30 am to 5pm
and got about 17 voicemails after 5
it didn't help that we also weren't receiving email from about 10pm sunday night until 8:30am monday because microsoft bought a company that we dealt with years ago, integrated all their accounts, and marked the ones that had quit the service as inactive
so our domain was marked inactive because 7 years ago we had some mail filtering service from some company
they just gave everyone a 5% paycut

one of my users sent me a specialty's cookiegram
pretty awesome
even though the cookies are like 1200 calories each
when you're like the most wanted in america
it's probably not a great idea to rob a gas station

I was joking, but three cookies is 1320 calories

gather intelligence on his dead brother
http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c0e_1366394274 looks like he got his head run over
beats me
this guy is one hell of an escape artist
I mean with 1 billion cops on you, you manage to get away
well, they already said a bunch of areas were 100% searched
THANKS OBAMA
did they shoot anyone yet
I wish I had a twitter account so I could tell lindsey graham he's a cunt
they thought he might have gotten on an amtrak train or something
I think that would be tough, to conceal an automatic rifle, suicide vest, and backpack of grenades on an amtrak while everyone in the world is looking for you and knows your face
I wouldn't say he's killed cops
since they only killed one
so he's not dead
:O<>O:
what
why did your mom dump you
pft: I'm just being a jerk
does taxachusetts have medical marijuana
so you're saying he's hiding in a different country?
Mustang|: how many cops/high speed chases did he do
the zodiac killer is still free, no all clear
he started walking, but everyone spaced out and didn't pay attention which direction
they did have a chopper last night
until like 3:30am, and then the chopper left
on cops when someone flees they catch them within like 1 minute
even that foot chase where the cop had a missing leg, they still caught him in like one block
6:24PM Possible sighting of the suspect in [REDACTED]. Police are sending units to investigate.
yes
there's a picture of his dead body on liveleak
yes
yes
no workirc?

I might die

he's on a boat motherfucker
his legs are moving!!!!!!!!!!!!
"specialty equipment to help you with your problem"
that's like... mafia code
did they shoot him, or is he pinned down
9-3 I got a good coffee
yeah, last night at like 1am pst it was "INTENSE ACTIVITY GOING ON" when it was a cop walking around with an ar15
I see a boat trailer
yep
where franklin bends
that's it
explosive ordinance disposal
and people in full body armor suits
my friend is in army eod :|
NOT TODAY MOTHERFUCKER
they're going to rip off the boat
but what are they waiting for

is that the bear?

nearly 30 people
out of about 170
no
engineers and a principal or two
some support too
I swear to god if this is real, and non-ucw's quitting means ucw stays...
a friend is passing my name to a google recruiter
they're looking for some windows admins
not in support positions
hopefully they'll want to interview me
well, kinda, they dug themselves into a real niche, and they need to extricate themselves

unlike snoozie, I'm not getting laid off
therefore, I am more employable

I swear though
if non-ucw quitting means ucw stays...
it just means I need two weeks before I start

he changed it because he doesn't like his dad
ucw has spent 314 hours "working" so far this year
225 of them on facebook
so he's done maybe 2.25 weeks worth of actual work this year
and he just told my boss he has over 40 hours of work a week and he's struggling to keep up
he spends 10 hours a week working on our backup system
(in reality <14 hours this entire year)

I'm getting the F outta here rather than getting stuck having to work with UCW on everything
toolbag: we're laying people off because we're not making enough money
he's on the list
or rather was
since other coworker quit, I don't know what his fate will be
but since he's told my boss that he works on the backup system 10+ hours a week, and that he has more than 40 hours a week of work, and he's struggling to keep up, and my boss seems to believe him...
we're not allowed to work overtime currently
maybe he should work period
according to worktime, he's spent ~14 hours this entire year on the backup system
assuming 100% of the time he spent on remote desktop is working on backups
apparently a lot
yes
but someone's got to select what to backup
which takes hours and hours you see
that would mean he'd have to know how to script
which he doesn't

which is just great when people quit or leave and someone else takes the machine
yeah
or the switch offices
so there's like 10 machines in oakland that are sf-

ucw - "sorry I didn't call in yesterday, my brother... uhm brother-in-law... uhm, cousin died"
still never offers an explanation of why he comes in at 10 though
pft: we use worktime, so his hours are easy enough to find
snooz: they haven't
and he's not... anymore
since other coworker quit
well, my boss will get what's coming to him I guess
he's keeping ucw around, and seems to buy into his bullshit, so when I leave, and it's just them two, he'll see support plummet

I don't have coworkers that would accept that

if you're not comfortable with powershell, it's a total pain, yes
that's what RSAT is for
also, I don't know how much they've changed it in 2012, but in 2008, some things were still gui
rsat can do 90% of what you want, remotely
in 2008, you go into a base install, type notepad, and up pops up a notepad window

to change the search engine that office 2013 uses, you have to edit the registry
does regedit even exist in rt?
pft: by far the most annoying change to me is that the calendar sidebar in outlook no longer shows upcoming appointments, just what you have today
and I can't figure out why they would do such a regression
josh: no
there is no way to see upcoming appointments in the sidebar, it will only show what you have today
or you click through future days

sickman: well, at the gabby giffords shooting, a CCW nearly shot the guy who had wrestled the gun away from the shooter
fortunately he was smart enough to know that he didn't have any information on the situation and didn't shoot anyone
but I'm guessing most CCW are not that smart
pft: I believe, that a legally registered NFA weapon has never been used in a crime
however, they have been stolen from the legal owner and used in crimes a lot
also simply owning a gun greatly increases your chances of dying from a gun shot
gun owners also commit suicide at higher rates than non gun owners
you're more likely to shoot a family member too

). When people call and ask for support, most of the time he passes it off to me, that is assuming that they don't just ask for me directly, since people have noticed that it takes quite a while for him to get things done. He has alternately described himself as not a desktop person or not a server person or not a windows person when asked for support on the phone. Infuriatingly, he passes off calls as simple as it says I need to upda
I get asked on a weekly basis what he does, and I honestly have no answer for them.

so... yay?
I wish
no, he says "without getting into specific comments on what ucw does do, we will have to realign, and relearn"
yeah
well, it's much more than that, but that's what it boils down to
I will say that his assignments will have to change, as will his attendance pattern for the foreseeable future.  We will need him here most of the day, and will need him to be handling much more of the tier 1 stuff as you noted.  One of the biggest problems I see coming is that we will need to realign our assignments quite a bit in order to make this three person department work, and that all of us are going to have to keep up with those a

well, I have about a year before I have to deal with it again, but I'll keep them in mind
yeah, sounds like it
I probably don't have enough for that to be worthwhile
but it's good to know
I mean, we usually get dell prosupport nbd, and if it's more than three years old, probably should be replaced anyway

so after email to my boss last night, he said I was mostly on target
ucw doesn't get to work from home anymore, has to show up on time, and will be assigned lower level, easily monitored things
and if he fails to adjust and learn, he's out
so not a total win
but it brings about possible future wins
yes
and how he fails to get stuff done, the things he does get done take forever, and his attendance is atrocious
and how he never shows up on time, and leaves early 100% of the time
and the time he is there, 70% is spent on facebook/huffington post/iambored/twitter
that's not an exageration, that's from our monitoring software
if I read my boss' subtext, he thinks he won't adjust and will be out in a few months
he also said when he was asked who could potentially be laid off if it came to it, it was a no-brainer to choose ucw
but other coworker quit, so there went that
he's been there 17 years :|
and yes
my boss just doesn't like to manage people
so he doesn't
but now that it's going to just be the three of us, he has to do something
the first three years of that 17 were in the graphic design department
if that tells you anything
I found out today that he was laid off from that department, for performance related issues
but my boss decided to pick him up for the IT department for some reason
he was the netware admin
in 1999
we finally got rid of netware in 2010
yes

so a week after boss told ucw no more working from home and he needed to be at work 8:30-5, he did 10-4, 9:45-2:15, and is working from home today
nope
boss is in paris this week
josh: of course, I can't work like this
it's literally just me and him
I cannot do everything myself
neilk: well you get in, you eat an egg and cheese sandwich on an onion bagel, you post on facebook for a bit, upload a video to vimeo, post more on facebook, go to lunch, then post on facebook a bit more, then go home
save time?
josh: he's taken two years to setup a backup system, it took him over 5 years to setup zenworks (and he didn't even finish), when things have been needed from backup, he's discovered that he wasn't backing them up, etc etc
and there have been zero repurcussions
also, seriously, there's no way for windows to output to two devices simultaneously
no cio, it's been reported to hr
however our hr is being laid off!!! so who knows if he even cares
he wants to be around enough to where nobody can say he just isn't there, but he gets bored
he leaves early because he can't drink at work
and he works from home so he can drink
yes
because he says "I'm hungover" a lot in the morning, talks about going home and drinking vodka and cranberry juice everyday, and has actually said "I need to go home and drink vodka" as an excuse to leave early
he's talked about how he hates when his friends go to AA because then they don't hang around with him anymore
and once talked about how he talked one of his friends out of going to AA
what betrayal is this now?

layoffs happening on Monday and Tuesday next week
rapes: his ass got saved this time because my other coworker quit first
somehow he found out that if other coworker hadn't left, he would have been laid off
so there's that
one of the guys ragequit yesterday, he was on the board, and was going to be laid off anyway
he was also a gigantic pain in the ass
so it didn't hurt too much to just disable his account right now
I wouldn't want to be on the board
well, he was an employee, and was elected to be on the board
bai: well, they voted to eliminate his department

woops

pft: haha, that's pretty much their strategy
6 months ago they instituted a 5% paycut for everyone and laid off 17 people
now they're instituting another 5% cut and laying off ~20 people

I haven't watched any of this season yet

I really didn't like it, until episode 4
then things started fitting together, and I saw where they were going
yeah, it's kinda lame about that

sweet, I want to pay $399 for pc games and newgrounds games
Bef: basically every other game they showed was cross platform too
why would they not show mgs
I mean, aside from ff15
which there are 3 people on the planet who care about
square has been dead for so long
ff15 could be fun
but judging from the most recent 8 or so ff games... I doubt it
Bef: pretty much
Bef: now that they're all pc based, there will be all these games on pc too
(his dick)
so he can play all those great vita games
like
the ps3 game uncharted?
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kqn4hy908W1qzsrrpo1_500.jpg
that video is why the conference was delayed
there's shit all over my facebook feed about how sony won e3
were they watching the same thing?
or is $100 less and used games really that big
$100 less is good
unless you want to play multiplayer
multiplayer requires psn+
yes
it's in that video that was posted twice
the text at the bottom
really, chrome?
I guess being that most everything is cross platform, $100 less is big
might as well just keep pirating pc games
titanfall looks fun, but everything else shown today for both platforms was kinda... meh
oh
well fuck them
just need mgs on pc
the new kinect is interesting, but I don't see me ever using it
if the xbone is a dvr, I could probably get behind that instead
ps3 does mkv?
I tried before and it didn't work
is there something I need to run?
Quiint: no, it's just that there's so little difference between the two now
xbone and ps4
Ichabod: but I have codecs
unless divx does something different
I have a wdtv too, but the more things I can get rid of the better
y
apparently, I'm confused
definitely not going to preorder either
unless there's more interesting info coming soon
ff15 and kh3 on xbone too
hmm, I guess this is going to come down to whether or not I end up building a windows media center to replace my tivo
or just get both like a non-poor
down? they're essentially the same hardware
the only difference is ddr3 vs gddr5
what? they're both running amd video cards
GDDR5 is based on DDR3 SDRAM memory which has double the data lines compared to DDR2 SDRAM, but GDDR5 also has 8-bit wide prefetch buffers
about half
ps4 camera thing is an add-on too
hmm
dunno
it's a camera and hard drive apparently
oh, no, it's a camera
well, the new move thing has two cameras
so I imagine it's semi-kinect style
I'm totally cynical, but I imagine that publishers will gravitate towards the one's style drm
josh: me either, which is why I didn't really care about that whole "controversey"
being able to access your games from a friends console without needing discs seems like a really cool thing though
I'm surprised that ms didn't put on chip memory like they did with the 360
josh: sony loves to shoot themselves in the foot like that
well, the 360 was also amd
ddr2
the graphics chip had 10mb of edram on chip though
yeah
except gaming enthusiasts wouldn't buy amd cpus
josh: ~48mb
well, that's why most 360 games didn't run in that res natively
they had a pretty nice external scaler
except for the console exclusives
which is really unforgivable in a lot of ways now
since making a pc game from a one game would really just be change target, recompile
of course, the same could be said of 360 games
since it was all dx and winapi calls
unless they were doing asm
superdae
josh: also, the one's graphics card apparently does contain extra, unspecified ram
but I can't tell if that's messageboard hearsay or what
on the 360?
for the gpu I assume you mean
bai: trying to figure out what to do for dvr shit too?
I'm tempted to just try to get rid of cable
I download most everything anyway
josh: oh, no idea
that's the problem, I'm not a sports fan, but I like having that ability
I mean, I'll watch the occasional football game
I loved the olympics coverage, being streamed everywhere
josh: right, but you have to subscribe to some $15 a month specific sports thing
like I'm not going to pay that just to watch mls or nfl
true
then again, I split it with roommates, so it's like $35 a month to watch occasional sports
I just need amazon or hulu to do live sports
yeah
it's comfortable in my bedroom
damnit, is the daily show/colbert off this week again
yeah, last thursday he handed it off to oliver
well, watch dogs looks good, but nothing super great
from the block
yeah
I like everyone saying how sony is so pro-consumer because of the childish swipes at ms
it's like they've never heard of sony before

Well what I would really like is a bunch of little n***ers to wear long-sleeve white shirts, black shorts and black bow ties. You know, in the Shirley Temple days, they used to tap dance around. Now, that would be a true Southern wedding wouldn't it? But we can't do that because the media would be on me about that, the lawsuit quotes Deen as allegedly saying, rightly predicting that the media might somehow put some of its typical spin on this. Ho
wever, according to Deens deposition, her idea for topping her brother Bubbas marriage with a heaping ladle of old-fashioned country racism had a very logical explanation, seeing as that whole Civil War era was just so darn aesthetically pleasing.
yes, imagine how the media might spin dressing up blacks like slaves and having them tap-dance around

so, our chairman of the board failed to get elected to the board last election
but the board still voted to make him chairman
so he's been on the board without being on it
one of the board members quit, and magically the board voted to make the chairman a board member
thus not changing the board in any way
nope
god, you should have heard the speech he gave when he wasn't elected
like how he didn't mean for this to happen, and he didn't give himself enough of his votes
just falling all over himself to try to explain why he wasn't voted in
the guy who quit had just been elected to the board too
he wrote an email that was vaguely reminiscent of the GHWB memoirs bit from the simpsons
like the 4 board meetings he was in he was able to accomplish everything he wanted to do, and now it's off to do something else
like he campaigned on a platform of changing the business, one of the points being engineering the tallest structure at burning man

of course if I've stabbed you to death, it might be hard to shoot me
if the other person escalates, you can protect yourself

Thanks so much for sending in your information and for expressing an interest in Bungie. Wed like to consider you for a position here! As a first step, Id like to set up a time for you to chat with our Recruiting Manager
woot
senior IT
yes
well, bungie's been around a while, plus there's a lot of places up there that are looking for people with my skill set
as opposed to SF, where everyone wants linux and shit I don't have experience in
yeah
bungie's like a two game company last I heard
anyway, time to go home
anyway, I probably won't get the job
they asked for a bunch of networking stuff I don't know
senior IT at Bungie
they requested a phone interview

jesus is cupping some balls
I haven't seen anyone with an ipod in a while
well, except ucw
ucw is cutting out paper hearts from a red folder
seriously
did I mention on here that he moved his boyfriend from SLC to SF?
they moved in together... with ucw's roommate
also
they met twice
before they moved in together
ucw flew out there for a week, and then like two weeks later flew out there for another week, then he flew out there a week later to drive with him to SF
I doubt it
he describes himself as gay but asexual, he has no interest in sex
which already is way fucking more than I want to know about a coworker
sounds like something some sort of josh would do
pfft
it's too expensive to make clothes in china now

http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/07/the-vitamin-myth-why-we-think-we-need-supplements/277947/ vitamins kill
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OJZ334/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A1S61SQFOVT8H0
In 2007, researchers from the National Cancer Institute examined 11,000 men who did or didn't take multivitamins. Those who took multivitamins were twice as likely to die from advanced prostate cancer.
In 2008, a review of all existing studies involving more than 230,000 people who did or did not receive supplemental antioxidants found that vitamins increased the risk of cancer and heart disease.
the gist is that taking vitamins makes you more likely to die from cancer
and I don't know where that amazon link came from
In 1996, investigators from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, in Seattle, studied 18,000 people who, because they had been exposed to asbestos, were at increased risk of lung cancer. Again, subjects received vitamin A, beta-carotene, both, or neither. Investigators ended the study abruptly when they realized that those who took vitamins and supplements were dying from cancer and heart disease at rates 28 and 17 percent higher, respectively, than t
hose who didn't.
The most likely explanation is that free radicals aren't as evil as advertised. Although it's clear that free radicals can damage DNA and disrupt cell membranes, that's not always a bad thing. People need free radicals to kill bacteria and eliminate new cancer cells. But when people take large doses of antioxidants, the balance between free radical production and destruction might tip too much in one direction, causing an unnatural state in which the immune
 system is less able to kill harmful invaders. Researchers have called this "the antioxidant paradox."

there's this job in SOMA that's totally up my alley, but they'd have to pay crazy good
that and I don't think they'll last five more years
they cater breakfast every day
that's some dotcom shit
you're telling me, I'm paying $800 for one room in a 3br
and that's cheap
even prices in hunter's point, which is the ghetto of SF are up over 100%
I mean, lookup hunter's point videos on youtube, and it's all crackheads and fight videos
there's this one, white lady gets in a fight with a black dude, black dude knocks her out, then steals her car
it's like every GOPers wet dream
I can say that, since my dad is a registered republican

my dad loved him, my mom hated him
my dad did vote against bush both times though

mill valley had like one homeless dude, got free american spirits and sandwiches from whole foods
lived near the electrical substation off the bay
downtown was literally like 3 blocks
my parents were like the white trash of mill valley though
bought their house in the early 70's
even had a rotting bmw vtwin in the backyard
rotting oak siding on the house
no HOA
they were the neighborhood
then our neighbor, who was a contractor, started buying all the land and building houses
my parent's deck is imminent domain, since they didn't technically own it at the time, but nobody bothered
well, at least a millionaire
sending his kids to private catholic school, owning a huge house
donating land to the city
owning at least two sailboats
my neighbor, my old boss, the founder of esurance, talked wistfully about having to sell one of his sailboats to found the company I used to work for
meanwhile I can never stand powdered milk ever again
same with frozen orange juice from concentrate
times are tough in the valley, yo

brushes his teeth, doesn't rinse the sink
spills shit on the stove, doesn't clean it
I don't think it's koolaid, it's red though
spills protein powder on the countertops, leaves it
handles raw chicken with the same fork he eats with
scrambles egg with a fork, places uncooked eggy fork on his eating plate
uses lysol like it's an air freshener

so it could be koolaid
also he keeps dry goods in the fridge (pancake mix, etc)

I can't believe he fit his house in that little trailer
I could barely fit my apartment in that huge van
(and I didn't, my arcade machine is still there)
yep
bai: https://goo.gl/photos/DHL5PzHpWiJtyWEi8
and that's before my tv went in, my bookcase, desk chair, speakers...
snoozie: of course
I mean, barely
but it almost all fit
I mean, it's a big van but... http://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2013/07/2014-Ford-Transit-cargo-van-right-rear-2.jpg
that van is 20 feet long, so it's at least equivalent to a 10 foot truck
well, 18 feet long
and I have way too much junk
who's that
I see
bai: can't find the picture after I first bought it, but there on the right in the back https://goo.gl/photos/kyZbdDNmpucTHtT7A

I need to fix my electrical system
are you using like wemo outlets? or are you not controlling that stuff
man, $60 for an outlet
yeah, the switches would probably be 90% of what's needed

bai: what kind of smart-ish thermostat do you like better?
what's wrong with the nest?
aside from the standard problems wall thermostats have with radiant heat
I wonder if you could hook it in some way to automated blinds to open them to let light/heat in
true
well, if nobody's up at that hour, sure
did you get automated heater louvres?
er I guess it doesn't matter
radiant, right
yeah
oh, only one zone?
is it water or electric?
I'm looking to do that but it'll be like 12k
partly because I need to replace the floor too
crawl space
I wouldn't do it under the subfloor though
well, I wouldn't plan to
I need to replace the floor, so I might as well lay down the tubing
yeah
I think my heater is large enough, but I'd want to replace it with a tankless eventually

if it's self leveling, why would you need to model it?
like, wouldn't you just throw that shit down and let it level?
ok
I need to get some bonding cement to patch the cracks in my driveway
also trex to replace deck
and you didn't install ethernet cabling?
well yeah, that's what I'm planning to do here
and maybe some orange tube for hv if I need to install some romex
but you ran tube, but no cabling?
I thought blue was usually lv
but, ok
it's a big gray square
oh, I guess there are some gradients
not high enough contrast
I'm not sure how you'd use a laser level to make that though
I have access to one at work though
I hope I don't have to rip up my walls to replace electrical, if I have to do that
it just seems like a pain
I see, and the laser hits the yard stick at its height
well, relative to where you stuck the level
white laser

maybe I'll finally get around to some real work this weekend
hand are all fucked up still
yesterday my dermatologist diagnosed it as psoriasis, and is trying to get me put on humira
no, it's all carpet
terrible, old, ruined carpet that needs to be replaced
it's just that your skin produces extra skin (usually in reaction to your immune system attacking it in some way), so you build up a lot of dead skin that tends to peel/flake off
and all that dead skin isn't flexible, so your skin cracks and bleeds too
super fun stuff
yep

all of that is essentially what zanshin said
except that I don't think he ordered the new tesla, he just got her boss to give them what he would have paid for the used tesla or whatever
so he could potentially get a new one
I don't think he said that
zanshin isn't vegan anymore, btw josh
no, he said he didn't want the used one because it didn't have autopilot and shit, only the newer ones did
he's a vegan that eats fish, aka, not vegan
god, I've typed aka way too much this morning

hi
well, that's disney's plan
they have a side-story movie every other year
and then an episode movie between
like next year is ep8, and then after that is young han solo movie
you mean in terms of changing the story/
?
I think that's all they're really going to do for the side stories
at least so far
I don't see how they could release a new episode every other year though, I mean, is anyone going to care about episode 12 in 2027?
by that time they'll be so far removed from the originals
I think they'll establish some side stories, and make a couple of them, and space out the main episodes to 3-4 years apart
like you know the young han solo movie is going to turn into a trilogy
or they'll do rogue two, which is about the bothans stealing the second death star plans before ep 6

or be like Moneo and just don't think at all
healthcare costs went down though
the cost of college is inflating because colleges are trying to
the cost of college is inflating because colleges are trying to turn to profit centers, and demand is inelastic, so people will pay no matter the price
no
most are
only really bad schools are not non profit, for the most part
cdc data for 2014 says per capita healthcare spending is 9250, oecd stats for 2015 say it's 8713
but yeah, single payer is the obvious answer
I know
just look at every other civilized country in the world
they must spend three hundred times what the US does
the go to the united states because their money buys them instant access, not because it's better
they get no special treatment in other nations
Habz: not exactly
minimum wage is the root of the issue right
http://www.compareyourcountry.org/health?cr=oecd&cr1=oecd&lg=en&page=2
feel free to compare any other countries spending to the united states
yes
but I'm guessing you disagree
pbs??? commie bullshit
we've been through this with moneo many times
it doesn't matter what evidence you provide, he dismisses it as bullshit
more money = better than
that's why no other country has any medical innovation
zero
never a single innovation out of any european country
and all those private roads
why not?
why are they at opposition
which private company is building an interstate moneo?
yes
private industry needs the roads to deliver their product, but don't want to pay taxes to keep them up
moneo is literally the libertarian paradise copypasta
DrGeeves save us
if only we could pay people nothing to work
governments take bids to do road work and are required by law to take the lowest bidder
only corporations should be able to make money
wait, living? people shouldn't be able to live
and again
otter madness
moneo just posted a gigantic ironicat
it is pretty great
not personally
bai: if only we could elect a republican that will cut spending for infrastructure and then point out how bad our infrastructure is and that the government is bad at infrastructure
like in kansas
nobody is smarter than moneo
did I say I was?
let's smoke some legal california weed
bai: you don't understand, the government has a monopoly on roads
roads and utilities are pipe dreams
got it
kickstarter a road
but you would agree that corporations would be better at roads
moneo ran out of talking points about roads after we shot them down
so now that's not what we're talking about
let's all move to somalia, the libertarian paradise
medicine
you hear that, taxes are theft guys
this is where moneo says that government has a monopoly on force
fda
they're incredibly good considering their incredibly limited budget
yeah
let's not dwell on facts
let's postulate
it's just that you're so easy to shoot down
same way we always go with moneo
he keeps spouting conjecture and talking points until we shoot them all down and he falls back to american exceptionalism
noted companies which don't rely on government created innovation
why make arguments when moneo can just put words in your mouth for you
but they do
google and amazon, companies that would exist without the internet, roads, the usps, etc
again with that taxation is theft thing
no
I believe his argument is that without the government the internet, this internet, would not exist
like aol
or the well
moneo again without any facts
just bad faith arguments and conjecture and insults
WHO CREATED QUAKE NOT THE GOVERNMENT!!!!!!! therefore government can't do anything
you'd probably spend it on ron paul coins
because it's illegal to murder people?
good thing intel relied on zero government research
bai's dumb argument style of arguing with facts
look guys, if you think the government can do stuff, you're wrong, because if you think they can do stuff, that means you're pro war and pro mass incarceration
you heard it here first
that's not the original in-n-out
look at somalia
cradle of invention
:IRONICAT:
bai: just perform a thought experiment where moneo is right
and you'll see
the internet: not a prerequisite for google to exist
history would say you're wrong
but yet here we are, on the internet created by the government
only the government did do it
but yet here we are with government launched satellites and government created itnernet
I agree
launch moneo into space
some private corporation was just about to create a launch vehicle that would be cheaper and better and faster, but then the government came and stopped them
some private corporation was just about to create the internet, but then the government came along and stopped them
look how well compuserv, aol, and other walled garden services are doing now
if only the government hadn't created the internet
woe is me

hopefully
it's required by law anyway
next is replacing the toilet and installing garage door opener
and then replace deck
probably...
it's like an original 1950 toilet, probably uses like 5 gallons a flush
plus it's ugly as fuck
yes
https://goo.gl/photos/zkgpFBHxmJbRTC8c9
it's this color
that sink is terrible too, along with the tub
but that's a more expensive project
:|
it's ugly
ANYWAY
it uses an enormous amount of water, and still has terrible power
why not just make a big cylinder ice cube
wewd: http://amzn.com/B00IU6R2AW like that?

everything is terrible
around
did he get injured?
what do you want to know about ssds
don't put words in his mouth
samsung 850 evo probably
unless you have an m2 slot, in which case get the 860
yeah, true
but pros are pretty expensive compared to evos
pros have 10 year warranties
depends how cheap you can get it
man, they're still 400+
evos aren't that bad
I have like 100 of them here, we've had one failure
it was probably all those gamma rays from his household star
I don't think wewd understands how nor flash works
Geeves: if you want a 1tb 850 pro, I can sell you a lightly used one for like $325
that's true
Geeves: they're 415 on amazon
just quint it up and do some research for a year or two
yes
overwatch isn't going to be FTP?
$40 :|
no, I like that TF2 is ftp
yeah, I know
well, if it was ftp like tf2, that would be fine
I mean, I'm not going to buy any of that shit, and it doesn't affect the game
well, it just means that I probably won't play overwatch

attempting to report a bug with the samsung calendar/email app, and they're requiring me to physically mail them the phone, and also pay them
yeah, thanks for the worthless advice
because the same thing happens there, since it's likely an issue with the email app
but I can't tell
gmail app works, but when it syncs calendar items, all the all day events are off by one day
other email apps have lousy calendars and don't sync with the built in calendar apps (so you can only use their app, and not a different app)
the issue is when the user sends a calendar invite, the app says it's failed to send the item, but it hasn't failed, it actually does send it
and it shows the calendar item as having a date of dec 31 1969
however what gets sent and what gets saved in the calendar is totally fine
so the person on the receiving end of the invite keeps getting emails until the item gets deleted from the mail outbox
and get some blunt wraps

oh
edge is ok, I use it for twitch, since twitch sucks at streaming
yeah
at least until ublock gets ported
I just had an omelet
what issues are you having?
twitch doesn't use html5 streaming on chrome
only edge and safari
because only edge and safari implement whatever fucking protocol they use
it uses flash
chrome has a built in flash plugin
with flash off, twitch streams don't load in chrome
or just append hls
https://www.twitch.tv/esl_csgo/hls
which doesn't load in chrome
like bluescreening? (frowny facing)
Ichabod: that plugin forces the controls to be html based, not the player
it uses html controls by default now anyway
when you click the gear icon, does it give you quality options?
because quality options are only in the flash player

you also might want to change the owner to admin on HKEY_Classes_Root\CLSID\{C2F03A33-21F5-47FA-B4BB-156362A2F239} and KEY_LocalMachine\Software\Classes\AppID\{316CDED5-E4AE-4B15-9113-7055D84DCC97}
ti fux the dcom issue
to fix
ruby is on it
even the owner?
open permissions, advanced, owner tab
otherwise just check the permissions tab in the compenent viewer
if it's already admin
click change next to owner, change it to the administrators group, so you can modify the security settings in the component services
or just remove the insiderhub/feedback tool
it's probably under windows components in programs and features
you can always readd it back
@w 94804
otherwise I'm out of ideas man, it's probably a hardware issue or like, chipset drivers

look at this informative graphic https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:6rd.svg#/media/File:6rd.svg
Habz: it means your traffic goes through clouds
you can do ipv6 with comcast if you have one computer directly connected to your modem
they'll give you a /128 (a single ip)
yeah

but it's teredo
habz gets a full set of ipv4 addresses
ipv6/32 is 255*255*255*255 addresses

there it is
found my notes
Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -online |? {$_.displayname -like "*getstarted*"} | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -online
maybe that?
it's either hub or that one
although I have hub installed and no reminder
but I also have office 2016 installed
yeah, it's officehub
so Get-AppxPackage -name "Microsoft.MicrosoftOfficeHub" | Remove-AppxPackage, then 
Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -online |? {$_.displayname -like "*OfficeHub*"} | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -online

if your ap can act as a bridge, sure
if it can run essentially any of the open firmwares, it can probably act as a bridge
or do you mean, your AP has a switch and is already connected to the wired network?
get a cheap ap that can run ddwrt and just connect that up as a bridge
or just like this, https://amzn.com/B00E98O7GC
I've never seen a networked printer <$20
as long as it can bridge, it's fine

boob
Xeus: how do you feel about her rickrolling the convention
my front yard is all succulents and mulch
man, fuck matt walsh
conservative dude
writer
he's writing that the plagarism is a fake controversy and a distraction, and the real outrage should be at the reprehensible move of having michael brown's mom speak at the DNC
he was the black dude that was shot 
let me be more specific
the one who was shot for walking not on the sidewalk
yes
he didn't have a gun
yes
the cops sat on him and then shot him point blank while sitting on him
he wasn't going for the gun either, the cops were patting him down
the dude patting him down felt a gun in his pocket, so he called out gun, and the dude sitting on him just pulled out his gun and shot him from 3 inches away
probably
and then shot him six times
well, I'd say 0 times is normal
you shoot until the threat is neutralised or no longer a threat
they used to teach you keep firing until the gun is empty
but then they shot at that guy in NY like 300 times
for holding a wallet
women aren't even people, come on
josh: as ronald reagan and the black panthers proved, the only way to get conservatives to agree to gun bans is to have black people have guns
reagan signed the carry ban and the assault weapon ban because the black panthers carried around rifles in sacramento
Ichabod: screech is in jail
I think so
no

he fucked up by being black

my parents and grandparents had a condo in tahoe, they just rented it except for a couple weeks a year
josh: generally you hire a management company who handles renting to people, scheduling, cleaning, etc
I'm sure for airbnbs they have cleaning people who will also do a little more than cleaning, and can call repairpeople for you
since airbnb handles a lot of the rest
Ichabod: they offer SfB in the office365 for government, so I assume they're relatively safe
the default for sfb is to store your conversations in outlook, which is easy enough for an admin to get into to read your history though
yeah, you can delete it
I mean, if you have a hold on your account, it'll still be stored server side, though you won't see it
never
I mean, if they don't enforce cert pinning it should be easy to mitm them

well, it only works if you believe it

yes, you are
the judge at most trials will instruct you to vote guilty if you think the defendant broke the law, and not guilty if you think he didn't
thus making it so you can't vote not guilty if you think the defendant broke the law, but the law is unjust
at least, you can't vote that way without being in contempt of court

you don't need the macos app unless you need app logins
otherwise you can just use the chrome plugin or whatever
the ios app works pretty well, yeah
the android version is... awful, since their solution is to make a lastpass web browser that you can use to fill in website info, and a lastpass keyboard to fill in on apps
it's bad
but at least on the ios app they don't even try that, you just copy/paste from the app for most stuff

I hate smalltalk
the thing about hating smalltalk is that you never make it, so when you are compelled to, it's incredibly difficult
and if you kind of naturally feel awkward, that can amplify it

I hella wanna quit my job dude
did you see me talk earlier about what my boss did?
he sent out a schedule, asked for thoughts, I supplied thoughts (I said what he wanted to do was ambitious and we'd probably need much more time than he scheduled) and he told me I was wrong and it would instead be easy, so fine whatever
this was emails between him and I, branched from the schedule, which was to the dept
he responds to the department saying there's been a couple discussions but nobody had any thoughts, so please share some with the group
the rest of the people respond, but I don't, so he responds to the group directly asking me for my thoughts
I say I don't have any
then he emails me directly asking if I'm having a bad day
like I don't need to be treated like a child dude
worst off later he tells us to make our schedule for going on the trip sunday, so my coworker chooses a time that she doesn't want to go and then gets mad when it's accepted, I give a time I want to go he responds by telling me what time I should go instead
like why did you even ask me if you were just going to tell me
if I can continue to bitch on a related tangent, this entire project is a fucking disaster, and for someone with a pmp cert he hasn't managed it at all
except for sending out "aspirational" schedules and explaining that he knows they can't be met

I didn't hear that

Nothing will change about Google Play Music in the near future, Elias Roman, who has been a product manager for both services, told The Verge today.
they might move in 2019 they say
but they'll move the user uploads there as well
so it's just a rename more than anything
do you pay for it?
ah

ads on twitch are the worst
yeah
I'm gonna have to switch to a browser with it
I use edge because it also avoided ads, because they didn't work in HLS mode (which only worked in edge and safari)
but I guess they figured it out now
also hls didn't use the dumb flash thing
but I guess that's also gone now
http live streaming
firefox had an open bug about implementing hls for like two years
I guess they finally got around to it
it's just a protocol for live video, like rtsp
I'm of the opinion that firefox is better than chrome now
but you know I still use an irc client from 1998

I have aids and I vote. Hurrr wheezing my way into the ballot box. Hand shaking, pulling the knob. Twisting the dial, turning the lever. Okay I pulled someone's dick not a voting knob. Curtains?!?!?! Stalls??? I'm dizzy and jizzy and disoriented. It's one small vote for a man. One giant vote for licking dick on the moon.

I also couldn't get ffmpegs http server to work reliably
yeah, I looked at that stuff too
meh, I just have it dumping to a dir in iis
now I just gotta figure out dual encoding because of fuckin' chrome desktop wanting to be special and only doing webm or whatever
I have it doing h264, which works for everything but chrome
at least on two machines I tried
real chrome, mpeg4 ts
I mean, if it does it with mp4, that's easy enough
I can try that too
doesn't it have to? I mean, it's basically just a bunch of serial video files
anyway, good to know I didn't waste a bunch of time on a dumb project
you need to do some media source extensions for chrome
I guess if I use one of these js libraries for the video, it'll work in chrome
I just have a straight video tag
nah
I was just saying I think I just need to use one of these js libraries to get it setup

2 hours
and then 6 weeks in a sling
4 months rehab
hi
I survived surgery
I know you were all worried
I've just been confined to a recliner for three days
I can't move my arm until the bandages and such are removed tuesday
I can barely sleep
so that's fun
also being high af on opiates all day
tore my labrum, damaged the cartilege
getting my tendons shortened and the damage repaired
no clue
:|
please don't
!jerk 
alright

I got my bandages off today
I have to stay in the sling not moving my shoulder for six weeks
this shit is the worst

I'm not going  to survive this sling for six weeks
I already had like a panic attack and feel like I need to take it off
sleeping with it on is total panic though, I only get like 4 hours of sleep with it
it's just so uncomfortable
shoulder surgery
they implanted 4 anchors and shortened my tendons
tore my labrum on the bottom and top
my right shoulder too and doing everything left handed is so hard for me
only 4 more weeks until I start pt, 5 more until I get it off
https://photos.app.goo.gl/4wMVChLiLYNFijX67

I gave up on managing the start menu and favorites
whatever you do, a patch will just undo it
Ichabod: oh, feature updates always reset the start menu back to default, kinda like removing appx apps, they just get re-installed
I guess I can constantly apply the xml, but people should be able to modify their start menu
do you run the script constantly to remove the appx files?
because feature releases just reinstall them
I'm sure it's not doing more than remove-appxpackage and remove-appxprovisionedpackage

President Obama announced a new executive order to stop gun violence in the US, with several new policies including a national registry for gun vendors. But he also called for gunmakers to update firearms technology, which would include not only biometric locks but a new idea to track guns with an app.
I'm sure gun owners will be totally rational about gun tracking

The Powerball jackpot has jumped to $800 MILLION for Saturday's drawing with a cash value of $496 MILLION!
lol
the advertised value is the 20 year payout
where they give you x dollars per year for twenty years
so they take the cash value, and invest it in bonds, and then pay from that
the cash payout therefore, is just what they would invest
3%
or something
on the plus side, you'd only pay like 20 mil in taxes or something
